- Pirate Nation is our first on chain game. Which means that every single action in the game is using a smart contract. So far we're in closed Alpha. You can buy a founder's pirate right now on Openc or any other marketplace and you'll get access to play the game.
- We're really focused on building a great game and that's actually a key differentiator for us. A couple of months ago, we migrated to Arbitram Nova, which has given us a whole bunch of different kind of improvements, like speed and another one like Cost.
- Nova is a signless and gasless gaming system. Allows us to essentially have this seamless gameplay. One really cool thing about blockchain gaming is the idea of a separate gameplay with bots. This can be an important tool for your fight against the bots.
- The next thing we built, which I think has been the most popular thing so far, is this thing that we call Mirroring. We have our gameplay on Nova, but we have our main tokens in the game on L One, on Ethereum. We're also building tools for nontechnical game designers to put content into the game.
- We're going to be open sourcing our tech. The next thing we're working on is this PvP protocol. This means that every move you make in the game is replayable. That means we can do some pretty crazy use cases. Have a lot of fun building them and expect to hear more from us in the future.
