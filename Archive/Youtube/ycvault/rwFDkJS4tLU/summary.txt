- The next panel will discuss the right reasons and right ways to approach strategics. The speakers are from Genentech, J, J,. Medtronic, and Novartis. All focus on finding opportunities and partners that will bring new technologies to their companies.
- Diego Ray was the CTO and co founder of the clinical diagnostics company Gene Weave, which was acquired by Roche. Currently, Diego is the co founder and CSO at Endpoint Health, a precision immunology company. Endpoint health went through YC in the winter 2019 batch.
- Great to see everybody. Really exciting to be at a YC bio event like this. The first one of its kind. We're going to be talking about partnering with larger biotechs, larger pharma companies, larger med device companies, and diagnostics companies.
- Jen Leeds is heading search and evaluation for Novartis on the West Coast and in Canada. Oncology, immunology, neuroscience and cardiovascular are the key top priorities for the company. Any notable deals that you might be excited or proud about that you can mention?
- Rachel Ray: I am a Senior Director of Business development within Medtronic. I really support the surgical innovations business. We acquired Smith and Nephew's Gynecology business back in 2016. It started our view towards specialty focus areas.
- Stacey Feld is regional head of Johnson Johnson innovation for West North America, Australia and New Zealand. Johnson Johnson operates across three main business units pharmaceuticals, Medtech, and for the next few months or so, consumer health. The idea is to build relationships early on to accelerate healthcare solutions to market.
- I joined Genentech as an intern in 2005. Eight years ago, I decided to take on a role in Business Development Group. We have a significant focus now on personalized healthcare and digital. A deal that I'm really proud of is bringing together leading academics and clinicians in neuroscience at Roche.
- Start at the beginning. Stacey mentioned getting access to companies like the folks here in the audience as early as possible. When is the right time in terms of company stage or stage of product development? The earlier you start it could give you a little bit more direction too on who your potential partner is longer term.
- Small companies want to move as quickly as we can and working with large companies is painfully slow. What are the right ways to speed things up and maybe just as helpful, what are the wrong ways to attempt to speed up?
- We are set up regionally in hotbed innovation markets with teams that represent our therapeutic areas. So finding your scientific champion, finding your business champion, and then following those relationships through that getting to know you phase. Great insight.
- The best approach is to show the science, the capabilities and then see how the conversation evolves. Having direct conversations with the scientists initially when you're building those relationships could go a long way in terms of how smooth the process feels. Do your teams ever proactively, go out and look for opportunities as opposed to the inbounds?
- We do proactive research and outreach to you all to learn more and see what stage you are at. Almost on a regular basis, we're meeting with all the venture funds out there and looking at the portfolio companies that they have. JP morgan event, which happens in San Francisco is another great way for either us to reach out.
- We primarily proactively look for opportunities. We take a coordinated approach with our colleagues in other regions to find the most breakthrough solution in a particular area. As part of our incubation efforts, we have 14 incubators under our JLABS brand around the globe. We partner with companies again when the time is right.
- A big question oftentimes is where's the front door? Right? Who should you reach out to first? The best place to start is with the BD partner that you have the easiest access to. Use LinkedIn, go to these types of events. Start with business development.
- Is it common that it's smooth sailing after that or are there lessons learned that could make things fall apart even at those later stages? I would say it's as good of a smooth sailing as you go from dating to marriage. Those relationships that you build during that partnering process is a good biomarker for what's going to happen once you are in alliances.
- The expectation of the partner company is getting a little more realistic. Financial solvency of the companies that we partner with has definitely become a factor. We're more cautious doing option type deals now. Being more on the early stage innovation side.
