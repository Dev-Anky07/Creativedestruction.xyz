[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:22.000 ] Speaker A : What's funny is I had hung out with him years ago after I quit Chappelle Show. We hung out on a tour bus. He says to me that night when we was all together, and he goes, I met you before. I'm like, I don't, I have no recollection. And he looked kind of hurt. It was a long time ago. There was, like, two, three companies ago. I just thought it was funny like, that he was the richest man in the world.
[ 0:00:22.000 ---> 0:00:29.000 ] Speaker B : Like, I saw an article that said Elon Musk donated $150,000,000 to some charity, and they called him a cheap skate.
[ 0:00:29.000 ---> 0:00:30.000 ] Speaker A : It's hilarious.
[ 0:00:30.000 ---> 0:00:31.000 ] Speaker C : How hilarious is that?
[ 0:00:31.000 ---> 0:00:38.000 ] Speaker A : Well, wait till they see when I'm a billionaire. Get ready for this cheap skate. No, my brother.
