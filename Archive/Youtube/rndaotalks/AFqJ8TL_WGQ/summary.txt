- Dao Innovation Lab focusing on research on Dao operations and governance. We are seeing a lot of potential to explore the parallels in between self management methodologies and different experiments on progressive organization. How we can learn from these experiments to also bring these lessons as we reinvent organizations in Web Three and specifically Dows.
- I got hooked on this sociocracy stuff about nine or so years ago. And that's what I do full time, every day, all day, mostly teaching and consulting with organizations. I will also talk a little bit about how it applies to DAOs and what I've heard and seen there. And then time for Q A.
-  governance is what connects the people with the thing that we want to do. In sociocracy, those who work together are the ones who decide compared to hierarchy. How do you do it with 30 5200? How does it scale?
- Double linking is a strategy to make sure there's good information flow. In that way, together with a decision making method, consent that I'll talk about later and linking, we can create a situation where no team can overpower another team. That's the way we decentralize authority in society.
- How do we manage power and how do we decentralize power while still keeping everything connected? We need to make sure that the people here carry the information properly, right in both directions. And ultimately that leads with a leader and delegate here leads to a pattern.
- In socioeconomy the people who work together decide together. Decentralization means different things or it can mean different things. Structure is really, I think, the most important one. Where does sociocy fit in? Decisions or policy decisions.
- The biggest problem is to decide who decides who decides about the governance system. If you don't have a way to decide that you're incredibly stuck. Sometimes it's best just to inspire people and train people and get them excited.
- Tedious question: Where do proposals come from? In a voting culture, proposals are made and then people vote, but they don't kind of organically come from a group. How do you make sure there is more transparency how the decision is made?
- Idea is to have basically a circle for operational decision and one circle for policy decisions. They sit together according to the domain. In each domain, they are basically policy decisions and operational decisions. And that, to me, is actually the cool thing about it, that you can have it made by the same group.
- Paolo: In DAOs, usually it is presented as everybody can be the owner of the organization. How do you manage ownership? And sociocracy is basically compatible with different modules. There's just too many options to really talk about meaningfully.
- In a Socicratic system, the Constitution is yet just another piece of policy that lives in a domain. And in our case, the governance agreement is held in Mission Circle. Mission Circle by consent, decides what the governance system is.
- The lifecycle of a Dao is expected to be infinite in the planning and governing process. If there is perhaps a parallel that sociocracy perhaps because it has this ability for the mission to be updated. To be continuously evolving and regenerating.
- Jose and Walter apologies, we're running out of time. Maybe we can continue the conversation on the Dao Discord. I'll share the link for everyone if we want to continue there or otherwise. Have a great day.
