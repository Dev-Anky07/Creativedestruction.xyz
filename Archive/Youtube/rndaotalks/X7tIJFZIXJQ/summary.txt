- In web two traditional product themes, problem space researchers really struggle to do this kind of research. Paolo: Problem space research needs to be funded and treated as a public and shared good cool. We need to build a way for the different DAOs to study broad problems.
- The first research problem that we've taken on is what are the common paths to becoming a Dao. The only thing that we ask you to do is to join our discord. And we do three workshops a week across different themes. You can join one of those workshops to see how we work.
