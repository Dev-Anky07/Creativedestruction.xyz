- Welcome to the apecoin AIP roundup. Number 55. And we have five proposals up for vote. You guys got till Wednesday to get your votes in for these ones. There will still be plenty of room for other people to join us up here. Feel free, send requests.
- Good morning. Look, I'm not selling my Blue Ape, but I need an invite to the Pink Ape Chat. Exciting week. Looking forward to hearing more from all the nominees and the AIP Roundup.
- Aaron is one of our authors this week. He's not just a regular with a cute hat, he's actually the AIP author of the week among the five. Let's go.
- Who else are we expecting up here? Web, Moss. Fuego is the other one. Are you familiar with AIP three four, eight? Because that's also on the ballot this week. SSP. Is here. I'm ready to jump.
- AIP roundup 55. What we discuss is our personal opinion, not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. Just providing the channel here to share information with our community. Going to send you guys some invites.
- Good morning Bradley. How you doing? Good morning. How's everyone? Great. Your mutin? I don't know, something about it just stands out to me. I love this mute. It's a good one.
- Webmoss also one of our authors of the week here. Looking forward to hearing more about your proposal. Maybe some different perspective, maybe even just similar information, but addressing a different audience. All welcome.
- All right, Fuego, I sent you an invite too. Luca, you as well, but I do have some summaries here written up. Sounds like my voice might be back to normal. You guys do the likes and the retweets. It definitely helps.
- GM, everyone. I'm here. 24/7 GM. GGS, all that. Got to address everybody. Such a broad community. Fuego. Good morning. Good afternoon.
- Apecoin Dow governed GameFi smart contract wallet. Aimed to improve active user engagement through the gaming community. Overall cost for this one, AFP 324, is $520,000, and it would be paid out in Apecoin.
- The objective for this AIP would be to introduce a white labeled Apecoin crypto Payment Gateway solution. Platform would include API for integration with other platforms including Shopify and WordPress. The cost of the service would be around 1% per transaction.
- Proposal would produce 50,000 bottles of Twisted Ape Ultra Premium vodka by Ape spirits. Monthly Laughing Apecoin Stand Up Comedy Show utility for all apecoin holders. Would establish a series of monthly IRL and token gated community comedy shows.
- AIP 324 would be the first proposal that we discuss. I saw Luca is down there in the audience. Maybe he's unable to speak right now. We'll have plenty of time here to get him up here and join us.
- AIP 340, the Apecoin payment gateway, another infrastructure proposal. Looks at around a 35 to 50 day, 55 day turnaround to get the solution implemented. The idea is to start small and then grow the solution as we go along.
- Start with NBA stores. We can integrate any coin. If we can get each of these stores doing $500 per month, should give us around $400,000. We definitely need to open our doors to the Web Two market and start catering and seeing how we can bring these folks in.
- WebOS invited Twelve Gauge to talk about their proposal to allow Apecoin to be displayed in ecom stores. Recently Coinbase Commerce made it very difficult to even accept Ape on shopify. WebOS sees this alternative of yours as being a very valuable one.
- The initial go to market strategy is to target and focus specifically on Made by Apes shops. What do you think would be the anticipation in the first three months of launch with those discussions that you've had so far?
- We do need, I think, different flavors of payment gateways, and I think that this helps. One concern that I do have is obviously on the regulations and licensing. Is this more of a passive piece of infrastructure that then the Dow would then manage those activities moving forward?
- Apecoin is a low cost solution for merchants. There is room to reduce transaction fees, eventually bring in a crypto fiat solution. All of these solutions can bring some revenue back to the Dow and open that floodgate up.
- I think definitely sliding into DMs, getting in touch with these folks, doing a bit more marketing, being proactive. Once we can get 800 stores doing $500, then we can really ramp up the promotions. I think this could grow quite rapidly to a much bigger sort of audience.
- The way these plugins work, they're quite straightforward. Once you've installed the plugin, it would just redirect you to a sort of payment gateway page. I think we've got a good sort of support network behind it as well, which we could bring over to the stores if they are having any troubles.
- All right. Love to hear it. You light blue backgrounds. You got one more thing there webmas for us? No, just like I said. If anyone has any questions or concerns, please my DMs sign into them.
- AIP here looks to include new infrastructure with the Dao in the form of Smart Contract Wallets. This would be for the Dow's assets or assets we may establish in the future. The Smart Contract Wallet would establish a lend asset process and a vault for the community.
- Proposal aims to introduce functionalities for web three gaming into the Dao. Will allow DAOs to manage in a professional way assets for a lending. Will be at the level of the brand of apecoin and ape community.
- I've got another little list here of just some of the things that are written out here in this proposal. Some of the highlights just to help kind of clarify what we're talking. Love you guys.
- There would be lending and gaming structure for these NFTs. This would potentially attract new people into the Dow. And I thought it might just be really helpful if I can explain to eight delegate, and maybe other people on the call might find it helpful as well.
- Today in the audience, we have our CTO from San Francisco, Omar. And they're behind the 99 Stars account. Omar, you can request the to talk more about the technology. If I'm wrong or if I miss something, then Luca can cut me off.
- Luca: The goal of these wallets is to enable the community to use these assets so that they're not sitting idle. As a result of them playing, the Dow will really decide the result. We are not aiming now as individual solutions to lend out through collateral assets. We're aiming at a large scale organization.
- The web three game rewards the players that play and win. The player gets a certain percentage almost like a commission. Anyone can be enabled to basically jump in right now without dumping large amounts of money. It's a solution to something that's ongoing.
- Would this include something like Sandbox land or other deeds? Would that include land developing in these assets in Sandbox and others? What do you mean by land developing? Is land developing as workforce like gaming. We definitely aim at having several metaverses on board.
- Lucas: Is this community putting in assets in a large way or is this the Dow buying assets like AIP two nine seven? It's both, right? But the mechanism, the governance is different. We are totally open for this. If Omar is here, let's get him up.
- Two Nine seven is the first thing that they're going to attack. But on the front end of this, this is going to require a management, marketing, Dow that manage this. Doesn't mean we need more funding, but we will need to make some changes. This will come from the experience and the thought of the community.
- Yat asked me to build something for the 297 before the 297 was drafted. This could also mean the sub communities. Where do the assets come from? It's going to come from the community. There's always going to be some need for the sales and marketing.
- NFTs are too expensive. The solution to the Web three gaming problem is for there to be some sort of rental program. Why should it be Apecoin paying 100% for the solution? And then we are infrastructure also for the games. With the new approach web three gaming is having, it's going to be adopted.
- Bradley: There is a big value provided to the Web Three gaming ecosystem. If there is a way to generate that ROI from the $40,000 investment of the gaming integration, then that, to me, marks an opportunity to grow the Ape Dow treasury. The main challenge for implementation is more on the marketing side.
- Luca: Each question helps me explaining some part of the vision of the product. If you guys have questions, definitely listen back. We are more than happy to answer all the questions you want. Sorry for heavy talks and boring to some sort.
- AIP 345. Straight into the vodka. Where Luca's at? It's wherever you're at. I've heard it's 05:00 somewhere. It's got the five right there in the ID right there.
- Captain Puego is looking to collect feedback from the Apecoin community. He recently started up Ape Spirits, which is a licensed distillery. He wants to restructure the AIP to make it more acceptable and appealing to the community.
- The Governance Working Group is hiring for a sustainability study that's now going to include a broader look at that. This would be the first AIP to offer revenue back to the Dow. We're looking to license apes from the community to use them on the bottles. We'll put this product in retail stores all across the world.
- Apecoms team spends an average of 555 days per team member on the forum. Combined daily activity and discourse represents a total time spent of 3858 days. SSP, I want to invite you to comment as well.
- It's encouragement versus support. We want to encourage people to submit their ideas. When it comes time to support people, the conversation changes. It goes from that encouragement to was there feedback provided? Was that feedback applied?
- Aaron: Is there a way that you can structure it a little bit more like a loyalty program? He asks: Should a board ape or a mutant holder with no ape coin get the same benefit funded by Apecoin as an apecoin token holder? Aaron: There may be different things that you could do.
- The original benefit of the apecoin and the dow was for apes and mutants. But some mochaverse NFT holders want to benefit from it as well. That's one of the reasons why going back to all city said 50,000 bottles, that covers everyone.
- In other communities, there's a threshold for even submitting proposals. At the Apecoin Dow, you need to have two nouns in order to submit a proposal. Let's talk about comedy.
- Fuego: How do you manage expectations feedback in the Dow and outreach to delegates and larger voters. He says Captain Fuego's frustration is disconnected to what's happening in the snapshot. Now, as we're all kind of learning, maybe there's a possibility we can bring in some revenue or better still, equity.
-  TFG: Are you willing to give away 25% equity to the Apecoin Dow? No. We have yet to launch any product. If you're going to approach larger distributors, you have to get into larger retailers. TFG wants to see a resubmission in terms of what you do.
- There is a distinct difference between the activity that goes on in discourse versus say, the delegates and the delegations who are voting and voting certain ways. The amount of clicks that we get on that link is really low. We need to do better in terms of drawing more eyes to that.
- Captain Fuego: At this point, I don't think it's going to pass. There's too much against it. I want to restructure it in a way that everybody's for at least a higher percentage. We'll work together to try and come back with a better submission.
- You've mentioned bringing it to retail. Is that something you've done before for an alcoholic beverage? Do you have prior experience in this industry? We'll be hitting the ground running as far as going global.
- "I am very happy to be here today and thank you for officially inviting me, " War says. "We got Aaron just patiently and politely not providing any interludes, no jokes, no comedy whatsoever during the discussion " War: You should have just thrown some jokes in there.
- AIP 346, the monthly Laughing Ape stand up comedy show utility for all ape coin holders. We will have a live component in real life. At least the first one's going to be in Las Vegas.
- Comedian Chris Rock says he was hit by a chair during an improv show. Someone didn't like a joke he made about somebody they were dating and hit him with a chair. Will Smith took it like a champ.
- SSP: We are two days away from the end of the vote. The French Ape Yacht Club just voted against us and no show in Paris. This is bringing some levity to the Dow, which we tend to be very serious. Keep it going.
- Aaron: I'm excited about being in the Web Three. He would love to be able to come to your city, wherever you are, and establish a host club. If you haven't voted yet, please consider voting for the AIP.
- I have questions for you. You guys that talk about the way the voting is going just make me nervous. I do not assume anything. We are very early in the process. You're also running for special counsel, correct?
- Laughing Ape: My time priority would be the special counsel. How might that overlap with your work as a special council member? If you're voted in, how might be any conflicts that you see?
- Aaron Carroll: Can you give us some insight on the balance of how you're spending your free time versus what you're doing for the benefit of the Dow. Carroll: Is my work like a client with a foundation? It's just as important and that's how I spend my time. Everyone has to come into the role and bring in whatever they think is best.
- Aaron Burr: I agree with Board APG 100% that you can run for president. He says he will commit to not running for US president until 2028. Burr: We're going to test G's Googling abilities. He wants to see some of G's comedy.
- Comedian says some people are more productive than others on boards. Are you in any way related to Morab? No. But he knows a few Habers now from web three.
- SSP: I want this AIP to pass and I want to put on these shows for you all. These are the things that help a community really thrive. And you give people a reason for holding the coins. Sometimes if you do things and you let that expenditure go through in the treasury to benefit the down and non financial way.
- It's not shilling if you're doing something. If you're actually building something, it doesn't even have to be a physical product. You got to have a platform for people that's notshilling.
- We got one last AIP to get through, and we have the author up here on stage. Lost, why don't you tell us about AIP 348? Give us a little bit background about Apecoms. We'd love to hear more.
- Aaron: I'm very passionate about bringing the Apecoin community together and the Dao community together. And I'm also very passionate, by the way, but in accessibility. These shows give members who cannot travel, who would be uncomfortable for them to go out. And so I hope that those who can't travel can get into these shows for free.
- No, that was a great final point, guys. This is where we come for advice on the Apecoin dow and the AIPS. You're the one that's running for marketing and community. I know you guys are about to take off, but I got a ton of questions lost.
- One of the things that I had questions about was the AIP process. What is your role? Did you get into Captain Fuego's liquor? What's going on here? Could you just answer the questions, please?
- SSP: I got endless questions. I got fun questions, got boring questions. Even the boring questions are good questions. He just had the one question. Are we ready? You dodged the bullet.
- Apecom's Collaboration for Education and Community Building. Would look to use existing discussion platforms like Twitter Spaces. Want to encourage consistent communication, engagement and sharing of information. We're willing to do it at zero cost.
- The Apecoin Twitter account wants to make it easier for authors to submit proposals. The team would also like to see Chat GBT plugged in on discord and discourse. This is just an idea, but the team is open to whatever makes sense.
- Apecoin will support the working group structure. Once we have the Ape chain, we're going to be talking about on chain governance. The discussion will never end. We're open to pivoting.
- One of the other things that we talked about during this discussion is this sort of community building aspect. It only makes sense for us to bring our conversations more into the community, make all of these different benefits available to the community. The goal is just to have the signal from the community that we should keep doing it.
- If proposal passes, it gives us that signaling that we can now take this as a foundation from what we built to something even broader. There will be levels of oversight. The goal here is to bring access and equal information to the community.
- I don't think our proposal comes as a zero value request from the Dow. I think the trust means a lot from the community and I think it's something that we need to think about for other proposals. What is the zero cost? What are we bringing to the ecosystem?
- SSP: If there's some way that we can return value to the Dow, obviously this is a big discussion. Maybe we could give the Dow 50 grand a year just for Sam Bluechu. SSP: Blue chew would be hard. It's an erection joke.
- Did you submit your name as a nominee for any of the open roles? I was going to do that whatever Metaverse related thing, and they said they don't pay any money. We're wrapping it up.
- Who's in the lead right now for Special Counsel? We don't even know who's applied yet. We're going to have the special counsel here on Wednesday. It'd be noon.
- There's no Thanksgiving in the metaverse. Get your proposal in when you know Machi is going to go to Vegas. That's the whole trick. Have you ever seen the turduccan that has the squid coming out of it?
- One more thing. Jonah's going to talk about his vegan diet. I'm not a big fan of vegans, honestly. Here's a joke for you. How do you know when a vegan walks into the room? They're iron deficient.
- Jonah: You have an opportunity here to actually create a budget that would really make sense. I should work for three months pro bono on the basis that you guys might approve a budget. Jonah's available possibly second quarter next year.
- The biggest volumetric soundstage in North America is two, three blocks from my house right here. And so just seeing the crossovers and the opportunities and seeing the skills and the talent, and it's about to explode. I recommend people pick up the ability to do exactly what Jonah just said.
- Ash, you got a new doodle and you're joining us at the last second as you do. We're going to be expanding our list. The opportunities are endless. We'll be back to normal next month.
- SSP is going to quit and go to the Mochaverse. We've got SSP questions coming soon with theater near you. Ape comes ride or die. Let's go.
- SSP is opening up a live stream show at midnight every day in the Journey Club members only AIP section. The show will address different time zones. Jonah: How much do you want for 20% of your company?
- Join Lord, Lord every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 06:00 A.m to 06: 00 P.m. PST. Don't forget to put your votes into legit, as this be. We'll have updates in three days on the nominees for the stewarded roles.
