- Tyler: I'm the CEO of Clever. We build software for schools. Sales has been a key piece of that. I want to share some of the things that have worked for me along the way. Of course, there's a million ways to do this.
- As a founder, you have some unique advantages that make it possible for you to be really, really good at sales. One is your passion for the product and what you're building. The second is your industry knowledge of the industry. Even as a founder who's never done it before, it's very easy to do.
- Only 2.5% of companies will even take your call or consider using your product. There's three ways that I have found most successful in prospecting and getting these people. One is your personal network. Another is conferences, and the one that people are most familiar with is cold email.
- You've got to build that first layer of the funnel. Then you get them to take your call. When you get on the phone, remember to shut up. Great sales is doing everything they can to find out what this person needs. Follow up and drive things to closure.
- YC has agreed to open source their deal documents. Make sure the agreement is the way you want it, but then sign it and move on. Avoid the free trial trap. Your goal is to sign deals and get some reference customers. If you don't do that, your startup is toast.
- Early on, you can think of sales as just like any other thing of a startup. But once you've done this enough, what you should start thinking about is, well, what aspects of this are repeatable and what aspects are we going to scale further?
- Michael Seibel is first going to talk about how to crack the pitch. Dalton and Casa will do investor role playingly. The best way to make your pitch better is to improve your company. We are going to do Q A at the end.
- Michael Seibel is a current YC partner. He breaks down the process of creating a pitch. Here are four things founders should know. The first is what your 32nd pitch is. The second is your two minute pitch. The more you talk, the more your opportunity to say something people don't like.
- The first is one sentence on what does your company do. The second is how big is your market. The third is how much traction do you have. The fourth is unique insight. The fifth is the AHA moment.
- Next, how do you make know your business model? I see so many founders run away from this question. Just say it. It only has to be one sentence long. Do the thing that everyone else in your industry does to monetize 95% of the time.
- The next one is team. If your team has done something particularly impressive, you need to call that out. So if you guys have done something that has made investors money, you want to say that. If not, then please don't go on about the awards.
- What we want to hear is how many founders, hopefully between two and four. Ideally you've known each other either personally and professionally for at least six months. Your only way to build credentials is if you've accomplished something and with an investor.
- You have to figure out whether this is a conversation that involves fundraising or not. This is the time where you have to know what you're talking about. If you don't know these things, investors are going to be like, oh, these guys aren't serious. Now is time to use a little bit of jargon.
- It's always better to raise money when you've got more traction than less. Never put the investor in the ultimate position of power. If you need money early, always plan for needing less money. Finally, how to set up investor meetings.
- One of the things that we're going to do today real quick is a mock pitch. Dalton Caldwell is one of the partners at YC. We're just going to try to show you something to talk to and use it as a learning session.
- Casser: We're building a communication platform that will allow businesses and consumers to collaborate on one single platform. Think about WhatsApp or Snapchat does for consumers. We think the opportunity is very big.
- We're live we definitely have thousands of users in the Bay Area, hundreds of businesses. We charge businesses, like, a monthly rate. How much do you think a business would be willing to pay? We think certainly $10,000 a month.
- We have five founders. Technically, I'm the only one who's full time right now. We're raising money so we can get the rest of the team on board. Can any of the founders program? I'm a Python developer.
- Make sure the person you're talking to knows what you do. You have to know your numbers, obviously. If you're very vague or evasive, like, don't even have a meeting. For market size, try to give some plausible bottom up analysis.
- We're in 350 locations in the Bay. What we allowed you to do is essentially message a location. More than half the messages are actually not about feedback at all. We're about 11% weekly growth rate in terms of acquiring businesses.
- We have about 350 businesses, all from San Jose to San Francisco. We originally built this product for large enterprise players like Starbucks and Walmart. The two paths are the SMB side or the LCS side, the large customer side. There's clear ways to make money.
- Every time you search for a business, there should be a message button. Our real vision is to become kind of that infrastructure, that messaging infrastructure, between consumers and businesses. We do want to just sell this as a feedback tool to large players.
- There's three of us, all technical. Mike and I did a company before. Sunny is a ex Google engineer. We come from retail, and our first startup was a failure. We've built everything ourselves and we sold everything ourselves.
- We're raising 500,008.5 million convertible. 500, 250 is committed by Mike Maples, Elad Gill, and Aidan Sinkett. Mike with Floodgate is willing to fill the round. We are closing around this Friday, and so certainly take time and let your other partners know.
- It was more of a collaborative meeting where it felt more like a conversation than just like I was interviewing him about something. In my opinion, he actually asked for money. You can tell when people are very passionate and know their business very well.
- After the meeting, follow up with anything other than a check or wired funds. Do due diligence on the investors. Fundraising does not equal success. Just because you fundraise does not mean you succeeded. Building a company is much more ambiguous.
- All right, thanks. Great. Thanks very much. That was great.
