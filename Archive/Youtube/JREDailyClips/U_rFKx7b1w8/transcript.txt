[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker A : You know what's amazing is, like, how many people came out of that Nazi party that were fucking incredible engineers, to the point where United States adopted a bunch of them. The Soviets took a bunch of them. They took all these scientists.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:13.000 ] Speaker B : Well, a lot of them moved to South America.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, Argentina.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker B : That's why they're very white down there. Yeah. Because of the German jizz.
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:23.000 ] Speaker A : Well, there's towns down there that are, like, fully German towns.
[ 0:00:23.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker B : Is that right?
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, they have.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, yeah.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:26.000 ] Speaker D : They went there and drove.
[ 0:00:27.000 ---> 0:00:27.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:00:27.000 ---> 0:00:28.000 ] Speaker B : That's fun.
[ 0:00:28.000 ---> 0:00:50.000 ] Speaker A : Tim Kennedy did that show called Finding Hitler. It was what the rumor was. The conspiracy theory was that Hitler had escaped and Hitler had made it to South America. And that sounds ridiculous, but for sure. Nazis made it to South America for fucking sure.
[ 0:00:50.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker D : Also, like, the ruin. I could see it.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:00:53.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know.
[ 0:00:53.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker B : Now they found it. Did they kill. They shot himself in the head.
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:01:15.000 ] Speaker C : They didn't find his body, though. They burnt it. He had his guys burn it. He ate cyanide, shot himself, and then they burned the victory because he knew we'd be on the Joe Rogan experience going, where the fuck did that guy go? Where's his he dude?
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:17.000 ] Speaker A : What's in the bag?
[ 0:01:17.000 ---> 0:01:18.000 ] Speaker B : What's in the box?
[ 0:01:18.000 ---> 0:01:29.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. You got to think about how many fucking insanely brilliant engineers and rocket scientists came out of that horrible regime.
[ 0:01:29.000 ---> 0:01:35.000 ] Speaker B : Hitler and Ava Braun's remains were burnt in a shell crater outside the emergency exit at the left.
[ 0:01:35.000 ---> 0:01:40.000 ] Speaker A : Who said it seems suspicious? I think Argentina is a better solution.
[ 0:01:40.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker B : What do you mean?
[ 0:01:44.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker D : Let me just throw this out. Imagine shooting ourselves, Argentina.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:02:02.000 ] Speaker A : Imagine they all just live in this town together, and they go like this. What the fuck was going on? We lost our minds back there. We got to just accept everybody for who they are. Agree.
[ 0:02:02.000 ---> 0:02:05.000 ] Speaker B : We went too far, had a good run.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:10.000 ] Speaker A : Agreed. I guess they just settled down, and now they just live there.
[ 0:02:10.000 ---> 0:02:11.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, they're retired.
[ 0:02:11.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker A : Like, there's pictures on people's walls of, like, SS soldiers.
[ 0:02:15.000 ---> 0:02:18.000 ] Speaker B : Why do we talk about Hitler more than Mao? Mao killed more people.
[ 0:02:18.000 ---> 0:02:20.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I don't know Enough about that.
[ 0:02:20.000 ---> 0:02:21.000 ] Speaker D : Stop Asian hate.
[ 0:02:21.000 ---> 0:02:25.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I don't know enough about Mao Mao Ying.
[ 0:02:26.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker A : But it's also. It's like, what do you have the most video footage of?
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker D : Right.
[ 0:02:30.000 ---> 0:02:31.000 ] Speaker A : That's what has the big impact.
[ 0:02:31.000 ---> 0:02:32.000 ] Speaker B : That's what it is.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:42.000 ] Speaker A : We got the footage, and Hitler was such a compelling speaker, and it was such a scary speaker with that creepy mustache. He ruined that mustache forever. Shane would like to rock it, but he can't.
[ 0:02:42.000 ---> 0:02:44.000 ] Speaker C : I want that mustache.
[ 0:02:44.000 ---> 0:02:47.000 ] Speaker A : If Hitler wasn't a thing and you had that mustache.
[ 0:02:47.000 ---> 0:02:48.000 ] Speaker C : That mustache is preposterous.
[ 0:02:48.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker A : You could own that mustache.
[ 0:02:49.000 ---> 0:02:50.000 ] Speaker B : Even ate them.
[ 0:02:50.000 ---> 0:02:52.000 ] Speaker C : It makes your face even fatter.
[ 0:02:55.000 ---> 0:02:59.000 ] Speaker B : Well, it's supposed to be Charlie Chaplin. That's what he did it after. His favorite comedian.
[ 0:02:59.000 ---> 0:03:01.000 ] Speaker C : What? No.
[ 0:03:01.000 ---> 0:03:02.000 ] Speaker A : For real? Yeah.
[ 0:03:02.000 ---> 0:03:02.000 ] Speaker B : Hitler.
[ 0:03:02.000 ---> 0:03:03.000 ] Speaker C : MJ brought it back.
[ 0:03:03.000 ---> 0:03:06.000 ] Speaker A : MJ tried it for a while. If anybody could do it, he could do it.
[ 0:03:06.000 ---> 0:03:07.000 ] Speaker C : And even he couldn't.
[ 0:03:07.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker B : Well, he's the best at what he does as well.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:10.000 ] Speaker A : He had to let it go.
[ 0:03:11.000 ---> 0:03:14.000 ] Speaker B : But wait a minute. I'm telling you, Chaplin was the reason.
[ 0:03:14.000 ---> 0:03:14.000 ] Speaker A : No way.
[ 0:03:14.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker D : Really?
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker B : Pull it up.
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker D : I heard him think that he liked Napoleon so much. Hitler loved Napoleon. He was like, great world leader, took over, dominated. So Napoleon had this tomb. Whatever. He's fine. He's fine. And he would make everybody. He built it small. So when you entered Napoleon's tomb, you had to lower your head out of respect. And Hitler knew that. And he goes in the Church of the Notre Dame, and he goes, build me a series of mirrors so I don't have to lower my head. I still want to see his fucking tomb. I'm not lowering my head to this motherfucker.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker B : Whoa.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:45.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah. And he was able to see his body standing straight up.
[ 0:03:45.000 ---> 0:03:46.000 ] Speaker B : Damn.
[ 0:03:47.000 ---> 0:03:48.000 ] Speaker D : Jesus.
[ 0:03:48.000 ---> 0:03:57.000 ] Speaker C : What a fucking dumbass. That's why I lost four. He was so good. You know what I mean, Phil?
[ 0:03:57.000 ---> 0:04:19.000 ] Speaker A : Bavarian mustache. The kind of extravagant chops you can hang a hat on. However, his superiors in the Bavarian infantry division ordered him to clip his mustache down so his gas mask would fit over his mouth properly. So that's why he had a mustache like that. Damn it. Oh, my God. What about that mustache was to stop gas to make a gas mask fit.
[ 0:04:19.000 ---> 0:04:21.000 ] Speaker C : Right. Did you watch all quiet on the Western front?
[ 0:04:21.000 ---> 0:04:23.000 ] Speaker B : No. How is it?
[ 0:04:23.000 ---> 0:04:23.000 ] Speaker D : Man?
[ 0:04:23.000 ---> 0:04:26.000 ] Speaker C : I don't want to talk about a true bummer. That was a bummer.
[ 0:04:27.000 ---> 0:04:27.000 ] Speaker B : What do you mean?
[ 0:04:28.000 ---> 0:04:30.000 ] Speaker C : The fucking World War I was a bummer?
[ 0:04:30.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Well, it doesn't get talked about because of the sequel.
[ 0:04:32.000 ---> 0:04:33.000 ] Speaker C : It was a true bummer.
[ 0:04:34.000 ---> 0:04:34.000 ] Speaker B : It's like Terminator.
[ 0:04:35.000 ---> 0:04:46.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. That's why the sequel happened. That's why he was out there. Old Adolf was out there saying, what the fuck? Why'd we do this? Because it was the worst, most pointless war, really. I mean, the worst was what they did.
[ 0:04:46.000 ---> 0:04:47.000 ] Speaker B : Two.
[ 0:04:47.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker C : Part two on the Eastern front was the worst of all time.
[ 0:04:50.000 ---> 0:04:51.000 ] Speaker B : Why was. Hold on.
[ 0:04:52.000 ---> 0:04:54.000 ] Speaker C : It's bad, dude.
[ 0:04:54.000 ---> 0:04:57.000 ] Speaker B : What was the point? That was his Franz Ferdinand. Was that it?
[ 0:04:57.000 ---> 0:05:01.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. I mean, there's no reason. There was no reason.
[ 0:05:01.000 ---> 0:05:03.000 ] Speaker B : Come on. There's got to be a reason he.
[ 0:05:03.000 ---> 0:05:04.000 ] Speaker D : Got talked into it.
[ 0:05:04.000 ---> 0:05:06.000 ] Speaker C : They didn't know, I guess.
[ 0:05:07.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker B : What do they think the reason was?
[ 0:05:10.000 ---> 0:05:13.000 ] Speaker C : Allegedly it was. Got shot.
[ 0:05:13.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:05:14.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker C : And then Germany was like, all right, we support you. Well, it was an Austrian. He was Austrian. Versus what? Serbia? It was in Serbia. I don't know. Fuck it. I don't want to do that.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker B : You're the history guy.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker A : History on mushrooms.
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:31.000 ] Speaker C : Everybody jumped in on everybody's podcast.
[ 0:05:32.000 ---> 0:05:33.000 ] Speaker B : History on mushrooms.
[ 0:05:33.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker C : But Jeremy was the first to be, like, escalating it.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:40.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, you can't shoot him. We'll step in. And then someone was like, yeah, if.
[ 0:05:40.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker C : You step in, then we all got to step in. Then they all stepped in.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker A : What's really crazy is that kind of warfare is not that far, long ago. No, not that long ago at all, man.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker D : That.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:54.000 ] Speaker A : That's how these 2 march towards each other.
[ 0:05:54.000 ---> 0:05:55.000 ] Speaker C : That was one, though, right?
[ 0:05:55.000 ---> 0:05:58.000 ] Speaker A : That was 280 years ago.
[ 0:05:58.000 ---> 0:06:05.000 ] Speaker B : But at least the Revolutionary War, you know why it started, but you know why they're doing it? Because of slavery, right?
[ 0:06:05.000 ---> 0:06:27.000 ] Speaker A : Metzger said to me last night, that was intense. Metzger goes, he goes, don't you fucking notice that in video games, the number one video game is a World War II game? He goes, because that's the last one. People feel good about winning World War. You can go back to World War II. We were the good guys. So that's the reason why you don't have modern weapons. You can't move quicker.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, there's no Ukraine.
[ 0:06:28.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker D : Russia.
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker A : Everybody likes to duke it out like they're in the 40s.
[ 0:06:32.000 ---> 0:06:38.000 ] Speaker D : You have real now warfare where they go, like, blowing up holes in windows and like, sorry, keep your fucking dinner.
[ 0:06:38.000 ---> 0:06:40.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, we'll move on now.
[ 0:06:40.000 ---> 0:06:41.000 ] Speaker B : It's drones.
[ 0:06:41.000 ---> 0:06:50.000 ] Speaker A : You're like some regular person, and you get online and you play, like, one of those games against these psychos that are on all day long. All day long.
[ 0:06:50.000 ---> 0:06:51.000 ] Speaker C : Just kill.
[ 0:06:53.000 ---> 0:06:56.000 ] Speaker A : People that are playing those games all day long.
[ 0:06:56.000 ---> 0:06:58.000 ] Speaker D : Hi, guys. What? New Modern Warfare.
[ 0:06:58.000 ---> 0:07:01.000 ] Speaker C : I tried to play. I tried to play them all the time.
[ 0:07:01.000 ---> 0:07:03.000 ] Speaker A : Poke your head up, it's gone.
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker B : These are strong. What are you guys talking about? These are strong, the mushrooms?
[ 0:07:11.000 ---> 0:07:12.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, they're strong as fuck.
[ 0:07:13.000 ---> 0:07:14.000 ] Speaker B : God damn.
[ 0:07:14.000 ---> 0:07:28.000 ] Speaker A : Video games are dangerous. They could take your life, absorb your life into a video game. You're going to have so much fun, you're not even going to feel bad about it. But then you look back, you go, like, how many hours was that?
[ 0:07:29.000 ---> 0:07:41.000 ] Speaker E : The last Call of Duty? War Zone was built on Ukraine, in a war zone, and way too close to reality. There's real life places that were really there in a city called, like, the.
[ 0:07:41.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker D : Monkey on the left, you see the.
[ 0:07:44.000 ---> 0:07:49.000 ] Speaker E : Monkey and the stadium, they have different banks and whatnot.
[ 0:07:50.000 ---> 0:07:52.000 ] Speaker A : That's damn different parts of the city.
[ 0:07:52.000 ---> 0:07:55.000 ] Speaker E : And it came out right when the pandemic started.
