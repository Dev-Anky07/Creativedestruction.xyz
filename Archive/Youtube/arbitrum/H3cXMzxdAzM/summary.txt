- I'm Terrence. I'm a Cordev. As of earlier this week, we are part of Auction Labs. So I had to change my name real quick before I get in trouble. So let's get started.
- Consensus Layer interfacing with hybrid PBS from its tonality. What does it mean when Consensus Layer inter faced with hybrid. PBS? Then we'll also talk about Mitigations.
- With mev block processing, it's a commit and reveal approach. It takes about three times slower to propose a block given the additional latencies. If the testers did not see your block, then your block may get orphaned.
- Fault here means that sorry, the site got a little mess up there. When you ask for the header, the relay network failed to return the header. Another type of fault is just consensus invalid header. Can the CL client detect these faults and mitigate them?
- So the payload could be invalid or the payload is unavailable. There's no falling back for this because you signed the signature already. We're still early, but we need more robust relay and also need a way to hold relays accountable.
- 49% of the main net blocks have some sort of OFAC compliance building. It's hard to figure out who is censoring at a given time. The UX of just figuring out how do we defend censorship is still early. We use the builder API as the best defense today.
- Hi. Terrence, thanks for a super informative talk. Regarding latency, the numbers you showed were more or less the same as Danny's in the first day. But I do think that we can do better from the orphan point of view.
- The three relay faults that happened recently. How were the malformed headers or payloads generated and how was that mitigated? How do we prevent that in the future? There's still a lot of work to do there.
- I was curious about the out of protocol cr lists and the proofs of transaction inclusion. Have you done any research into it? Is it practical? Like, would the builders or the relayers be actually able to calculate the proofs in time?
- Darian: 50% of the network is making use of Mev Boost. Why do we think that proofs help in that? Why can't you just disconnect from that relay? It's too early to be using this type of technology unless you know what you're doing.
