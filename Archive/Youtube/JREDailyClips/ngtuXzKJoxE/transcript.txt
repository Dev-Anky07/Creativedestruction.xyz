[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:44.000 ] Speaker A : Say this, something like this happens, right? You're like, you're leaving work. Okay, okay. And things got compromised out in the world. You were at work, you were doing a podcast episode or something. And like, things just kind of hit that level where it's like maybe a couple police precincts have been taken over just by vandals and crazies. Like. Like the pendulum starting to. Things are getting like AWOL, right? And then everything. The purge, right? So you're driving home, you're getting fucking. Cam Haynes is sending you fucking 1000 hammers. You know what I'm saying? You're getting all of you, everybody's just texting you. Jaco is like, I'm not even waking up tomorrow for work. I'll be up all. I'm just going to be up at 430, right? Everything's all, what do you do?
[ 0:00:44.000 ---> 0:00:45.000 ] Speaker B : This is the end.
[ 0:00:45.000 ---> 0:00:54.000 ] Speaker A : This is when it's like, all right, Joe Rogan. You know what I'm saying? You hear, it just comes from God or from something like a strong wind with a voice box in it. You.
[ 0:00:54.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker B : It's like, this is it.
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker C : This is the apocalypse.
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:00:57.000 ] Speaker A : You're leaving work.
[ 0:00:57.000 ---> 0:00:58.000 ] Speaker B : This is it.
[ 0:00:58.000 ---> 0:01:13.000 ] Speaker C : I guess you have to respond to each individual situation. Each thing will be unique. Like, is someone trying to break in your house? Is someone trying to rob your. Is someone trying to break in your car while you're driving?
[ 0:01:13.000 ---> 0:01:22.000 ] Speaker A : Okay, so you have an hour. You have kind of an hour. We'll give you 90 minutes. You have 90 minutes to kind of get before you're going to start to feel some pressure.
[ 0:01:23.000 ---> 0:01:24.000 ] Speaker C : What do you do?
[ 0:01:24.000 ---> 0:01:25.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know.
[ 0:01:25.000 ---> 0:01:27.000 ] Speaker C : I guess load up some magazines.
[ 0:01:27.000 ---> 0:01:30.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, I'm fucked. But I'm wondering, what do you do?
[ 0:01:30.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker C : That's what I would do. I'd probably load up some magazines.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:34.000 ] Speaker A : Okay. Into what?
[ 0:01:35.000 ---> 0:01:36.000 ] Speaker C : Into guns.
[ 0:01:36.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker D : Okay. Yeah, see, I don't know if you fucking know.
[ 0:01:43.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker C : Sports Illustrated. I mean, like an AR.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:51.000 ] Speaker D : This guy's taking information with him into a bunker.
[ 0:01:51.000 ---> 0:01:53.000 ] Speaker C : I'm reading Time magazine.
[ 0:01:54.000 ---> 0:02:00.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, dude. I'm like, I just see Joe with as many copies of field and stream as you go fucking live.
[ 0:02:00.000 ---> 0:02:06.000 ] Speaker C : Well, you could use those magazines as like, protection. You stack enough of each other.
[ 0:02:06.000 ---> 0:02:13.000 ] Speaker A : Okay, see, now you're thinking slow bullets down. Okay. Say like, you pick up your family or something. Do you guys stay? Do you have a bunker?
[ 0:02:14.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker C : I don't currently, but this conversation is making me want a bunker. I've wanted a ranch for that very reason. Like, if shit goes completely sideways, it would be great if there was a place with water and food where you got your water, you got your food, like on the property.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:38.000 ] Speaker A : Okay. What about if you're kind of in a city or you're in what's maybe a business or something you'd hold up in you think is viable?
[ 0:02:38.000 ---> 0:02:43.000 ] Speaker C : A business that I'd hold up in. It would have to be some sort of fortified establishment.
[ 0:02:43.000 ---> 0:02:44.000 ] Speaker A : Like the mall.
[ 0:02:44.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker C : No, you'd have to get something that you could defend.
[ 0:02:50.000 ---> 0:02:51.000 ] Speaker A : Dude, the mall?
[ 0:02:52.000 ---> 0:02:53.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, the mall.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:03:00.000 ] Speaker A : I think. Because you'd have probably like think of all you could hide in the fucking Macy's behind all the hiding cinnabon behind the counter.
[ 0:03:02.000 ---> 0:03:05.000 ] Speaker D : Just squeeze a frosting into your mouth, pumping shells.
[ 0:03:05.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker C : It would be a good excuse to eat that food because I got to eat something.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:20.000 ] Speaker A : And that stuff will keep because a lot of that stuff has like all the preservatives. Preservatives in it. So you'd have that. You'd have mannequins in there. Think about that. You could set up like a mirage.
[ 0:03:20.000 ---> 0:03:26.000 ] Speaker C : Right? Like a fake sort of situation where people would think that, but you're behind that.
[ 0:03:27.000 ---> 0:03:35.000 ] Speaker A : So the mall, I think, could be good. Yeah. What would you get about that? I would go to the mall.
[ 0:03:35.000 ---> 0:03:35.000 ] Speaker C : Really?
[ 0:03:35.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, the mall?
[ 0:03:37.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:03:37.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker A : Because nobody's at the mall anymore.
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:03:41.000 ] Speaker C : But the dumbest people are at the mall. They're going to fuck it up for you.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker A : They got to go.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:48.000 ] Speaker C : They're going to go. The Russians are here, guys. Okay, shut the fuck up. I'm pretending to be a mannequin.
[ 0:03:51.000 ---> 0:03:54.000 ] Speaker D : I'm like, hey, get me a medium.
[ 0:03:58.000 ---> 0:04:10.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that's going to be the problem is dumb people. When shit goes south, there's some people that just like, they're ditch diggers, they're dumb people. They're minimum wage thinkers.
[ 0:04:11.000 ---> 0:04:17.000 ] Speaker A : But they're going to have a lot of weapons, though, probably, maybe. I don't know. I think a lot of people have weapons now, but I think if things.
[ 0:04:17.000 ---> 0:04:22.000 ] Speaker C : Go sideways, a lot of people are Going to panic in the chaos, right?
[ 0:04:22.000 ---> 0:04:28.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, immediately people will be panicking. People be trying to group up. Some people will be trying to salvage shit. That person's going to go.
[ 0:04:28.000 ---> 0:04:39.000 ] Speaker C : That person is going to go, yeah, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to fall apart. But that's always, like, whenever things go weird, people fall apart. A lot of people don't respond to pressure very well.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I know. I got stuck in an elevator one time. I was at Mardi Gras and we were in there for like 17 minutes and some dude, there's two girls and there's like nine people. It was like a busy day at Mardi Gras. I'm there with my budy, Josh Kelly. He's a musician. He's playing. We take this elevator, and like nine of us get stuck in this elevator for like, maybe an hour. But you can hear Mardi Gras going around. We're like, how long are we going to be in here? And we're in there in a little while, and some guy goes to two girls in there. He goes, don't worry, nobody in here is going to rape y'all. That's what he said. And suddenly everything in there just changed. We're like, nobody's even thinking about that.
[ 0:05:15.000 ---> 0:05:17.000 ] Speaker C : Know, how big is this elevator?
[ 0:05:17.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker A : It was probably. Honestly, I bet it was almost as big as this table.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:25.000 ] Speaker C : Big elevator.
[ 0:05:25.000 ---> 0:05:28.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Maybe 2ft smaller on that end. Maybe 1ft.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker C : So not so big elevator.
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:33.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. And some guy kept trying to just pull the doors open as hard as he could.
[ 0:05:33.000 ---> 0:05:35.000 ] Speaker C : And how many people are in there with you?
[ 0:05:35.000 ---> 0:05:37.000 ] Speaker A : I would say seven people.
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:05:38.000 ] Speaker C : Seven people. And two of them are girls.
[ 0:05:38.000 ---> 0:05:40.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, boy.
[ 0:05:40.000 ---> 0:05:42.000 ] Speaker C : Suck to be them after that idiot has to say that.
[ 0:05:42.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, dude.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:45.000 ] Speaker C : Because they have to think about that.
[ 0:05:45.000 ---> 0:05:47.000 ] Speaker A : No one's going to rape you.
[ 0:05:47.000 ---> 0:05:49.000 ] Speaker C : Like, what the fuck, man? Imagine.
[ 0:05:49.000 ---> 0:05:52.000 ] Speaker A : And if he's not thinking about raping them, then you think he's going to be thinking about.
[ 0:05:52.000 ---> 0:05:54.000 ] Speaker C : Did anybody tell him to shut the fuck up?
[ 0:05:54.000 ---> 0:06:01.000 ] Speaker A : People just said, calm down, calm down. But it was just interesting how it escalated. Like, things started to escalate.
[ 0:06:01.000 ---> 0:06:04.000 ] Speaker C : Have you ever been in a riot? Like a riot type situation?
[ 0:06:05.000 ---> 0:06:10.000 ] Speaker A : No. I was at beta breakers one time on mushrooms in San FraNcisco, though.
[ 0:06:10.000 ---> 0:06:11.000 ] Speaker D : Beta breakers.
[ 0:06:11.000 ---> 0:06:13.000 ] Speaker C : What is beta breakers? What is that?
[ 0:06:13.000 ---> 0:06:23.000 ] Speaker A : It's like a bunch of people. They're like racers. They race in the. Know what kind of racing? Just for long distance. The canyons always win it.
[ 0:06:23.000 ---> 0:06:24.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, okay.
[ 0:06:24.000 ---> 0:06:27.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, running, racing. So it's a bunch of those folks.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker C : Bay two breakers. I thought you were saying beta breakers.
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, Bay two breakers.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:38.000 ] Speaker D : I thought he was saying that, too. I typed in, oh, no, beta breakers.
[ 0:06:38.000 ---> 0:06:39.000 ] Speaker A : I think, is a little different.
[ 0:06:39.000 ---> 0:06:40.000 ] Speaker C : Bay two breakers.
[ 0:06:40.000 ---> 0:06:46.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, that's the run. So that's the run. And you can just get in costumes and just be in it.
[ 0:06:46.000 ---> 0:06:50.000 ] Speaker C : It's like, oh, like the dude is dressed up like a pink monkey.
[ 0:06:50.000 ---> 0:06:50.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:06:50.000 ---> 0:06:54.000 ] Speaker C : How weird is that? And he's at the front. Oh, McDonald's, they dress up like Ronald McDonald.
[ 0:06:55.000 ---> 0:06:55.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:06:55.000 ---> 0:06:57.000 ] Speaker A : So people just do all kind of costumes.
[ 0:06:57.000 ---> 0:06:58.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, interesting.
[ 0:06:58.000 ---> 0:07:05.000 ] Speaker A : And we ate a bunch of shrooms out there and kind of commandeered this water table. There was a water table that had kind of been left unattended.
[ 0:07:05.000 ---> 0:07:06.000 ] Speaker C : What is a water table?
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:08.000 ] Speaker A : Just a table with a bunch of cups.
[ 0:07:08.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker C : Waters on it.
[ 0:07:09.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker A : Okay. So we got over there and people were running. They're going. And we started telling people that the water was for Asian people only, right? We are crying, laughing, because people are running. They can't stop. They're trying to make a time. So for some people, be like, bro, it's Asians only. And it was like, why? And then Asian people were all excited.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:32.000 ] Speaker D : And we kept doubting them up.
[ 0:07:32.000 ---> 0:07:39.000 ] Speaker A : Dude, we were fucking. I would take pictures with people and I'd have my fucking nuts hanging out.
[ 0:07:39.000 ---> 0:07:41.000 ] Speaker D : The whole time we were out.
[ 0:07:42.000 ---> 0:07:45.000 ] Speaker C : Pictures of people. How old are you at the time?
[ 0:07:45.000 ---> 0:07:46.000 ] Speaker D : I don't know, man.
[ 0:07:46.000 ---> 0:07:57.000 ] Speaker A : Probably 28. And people are like, hey, let's get a picture together. So we get it, and I just slip that bag out there, maybe that fucking gum holster, you know what I'm saying?
