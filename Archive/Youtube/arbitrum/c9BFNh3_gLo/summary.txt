- Today we have the first builders of Arbitrum with us. We have the pioneers of off chain labs. They will share how they are still building for the ecosystem.
- Hi. Welcome to the second panel of the day. We have the founders of the off chain apps that were already introduced. These three founders have been scaling ethereum for years. I want to know where we are at, where are we going, what's next in terms of the evolution of infrastructure.
- Stephen Curry: Can you talk about scaling solutions and the history of scaling solutions since 2016? He says Arbitram was among the very first attempts at scaling solutions for smart contracts. Curry: As roll ups have gained in popularity, people are saying, can we somehow get that data bit back and take the data off Ethereum?
- In roll ups there are primarily two directions. There are ZK roll ups and there are optimistic roll ups. All roll ups do the same thing in some sense, which is they take computation off chain and they put the result on chain. Today roll ups are basically seen as the scaling solution.
- Harry, I wanted to ask you to talk a bit more about orbit chains. What are they and how do they fit into the future? Over the course of the next year it's going to become increasingly easier and easier.
- The ability to customize and modularize the stack and substitute in. Data availability solutions. Customizing state transition functions and editing kind of the core functionality of how chains work. The entire ecosystem consolidating around this kind of shared goal of improving technology.
- Arbitram Stylus allows you to write programs in other languages, right? Smart contracts and other languages. And potentially, and my hope is that this has a chance of even getting back to Ethereum layer One if it's successful.
- Bold is the next generation fraud proof protocol or challenge protocol for Arbitram. It makes it safe for the validator role in the protocol to be permissionless. Any ordinary user of Arbitrum with an ordinary computer can force the chain to execute correctly. This is the largest remaining step in the decentralization roadmap for arbitrary.
- It's been almost six months that Arbitrum Dao was launched. I think that the Arbitram Dao is about the most engaged Dow that I've ever seen. In the coming months and year, there's going to be a lot more in the way of technical proposals in front of the Dow.
- Harry: Is there anything that you guys are doing research on that would impact the arbitrary ecosystem? Ed: There's a ton of amazing research going on in this community. I'm really excited to be working on one of the teams that is pushing that agenda forward.
- A lot of them today, if I had to sum everything up in a world, it would be basically decentralization. So yeah, I think really Arbitram is growth from a technology perspective, from a community perspective and from a Dow perspective. And I think it's super exciting to see.
- Mask: It's incredible to see how everything started in a classroom and now Arbitram is the most decentralized layer two and advanced. And it's beautiful to see this collaboration between you, between the Arbitram Foundation and the community in general. At the end for a better a better present and a better future.
