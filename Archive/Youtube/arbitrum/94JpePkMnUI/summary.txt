- GM. Chad: Hope everyone's having a good day. Where are you based out of? I'm based in New York. Cold day Midwest is getting a little hot, depending on where you're at. Maybe we could briefly go over what Arbitrum is, what a bridge is, and then go a little bit deeper into what the NFT ecosystem looks like.
- At fractional, we see issues with gas fees all the time. I think L two S are super powerful and people should be educated on them. Stephen and Size Chad to talk a little bit more about it.
- Arbitrum is a layer two scaling platform for ethereum. The key principle of what we're doing is inclusivity. We want to include more apps and include more people. If we can lower fees we can make the barriers to entry lower.
- While you were talking, I also brought up Sobi, who I know is also a big fan of what's going on on Arbitrum. I think Arbitrum has a good opportunity to be like the leader layer two solution that rivals the whole total amount of value transferred.
- For me, the most exposure I have to Arbitram is through magic. I don't know where we want to take the NFT discussion. A big part of this call should just be to educate people that are artists or collectors, et cetera, that are interested in using Arbitram.
- GMX Blueberries are launched by are part of the GMX ecosystem. I really like seeing the merging of DFI and NFTs. I think Gamifying DFI has so much upside and making it more fun.
- Two L, two layers right now are kind of doing well: Arbitram and Immutable X. Arbitram has a really strong flourishing DeFi community and a growing NFT community. These experiences only happen when you have a general platform with full smart contract support.
- I love seeing all the small brains come up. So if you have a small brain and you request I'm 100% tapping. And we also have nexus. Welcome to the stage.
- Some of the biggest content creators for old school RuneScape are also heavily involved in magic and treasure. Some of them have been here since November, so they've been in early as hell. I keep seeing a lot of crappy knockoff projects that I don't want to call out.
- There will be more than one chain for the long term, and many of these chains will have NFTs. In the short term I think we'll see NFT bridges popping up. Can you build experiences that are really cross chain?
- The way to think about Arbitram is really like its own chain. There's ways to bridge trustlessly between ethereum and Arbitrum. Whatever you can do on any EVM chain, can do with Arbitrum as well. Deep Bridging is a much more advanced area of research at this point.
- Are you guys potentially interested in going down the ZK roll up route? There isn't currently an EVM compatible ZK Roll up out right now, but there will be one soon. Arbitram is the leading layer two scaling solution today on Ethereum. But the key is doing this as we go.
- Stephen: Are you saying that you don't think any EVM compatible ZK roll up will be scalable enough? ZK Sync published would be about 175 times as scalable as Ethereum main net. Do you think the amount of scalability required is soon going to outpace that form of roll up?
- Are you concrete about your current validation metrics or would you potentially ever look at changing them? Right now, we believe that optimistic roll ups are the most viable path to scaling ethereum. But of course we can be wrong and we will absolutely make changes.
- How decentralized or centralized is your equity distribution going to be on Arbitrum? Arbitram does not have a native token today. And I think our goal always is to do something that's very inclusive to the community.
- I think I'm back. Can you guys hear me right now? Extremely loud. Okay. I restarted my app and clenched because I couldn't hear for like five minutes. I didn't want the app to restart and rug the space, but glad I am back.
- Bridging is a mechanism to lock on chain one and show up on chain two. The defining feature of layer two of an optimistic roll up, or really a roll up in general, is that those bridges can operate trustlessly.
- People will pay millions of dollars for an NFT on main chain because it will exist for hundreds of years. One thing that I see different on Arbitrum than other side chain or layer two NFT ecosystems is on Arbitram we really see high value.
- Startwithmagic. com is an all around introductory website that helps people get kind of onboarded to magic if they're new. If anyone knows about different things we can do with our small brains or what's going on with magic, any alpha would be appreciated.
- In order to get utility from your small brain, you require a pair, male and female, and you also require a piece of land. It's truly amazing to me how there are still people wondering what they can do with their NFTs on L One when there's so much things you can do on L Two.
- A friend of mine is developing a new form of bridge that allows you to transfer the NFT itself with all the utility and contract address attached. We've got folks on our team who've been looking at this. It's a key component of how to approach building into ecosystems.
- I can definitely comment a little bit also on the NFT bridging stuff, especially in terms of utility. Is the contract address on Arbitrum standard for every single board Ape transferred or is it unique for every individual? It really just depends on how the bridge is constructed itself.
- Yeah, and I see I have a couple other requests. I'm pretty much wide open. I'll bring a couple of new people up real quick. All right. Wind you up and watch you go.
- Is it possible to do some type of off chain transaction. for NFTs that is not essential that they be locked up while the NFT is active on another chain, so to speak. I'm still trying to figure out the bounds of what fits in this category.
- GM: When I first used arbitram with Dopex, it was just like ten minutes. The bridge over as it works right now is really fast, really easy, really awesome. But then there's always that one week to get off.
- FTX is starting to support arbitration main net. What they do is they just bridge a lot of funds over and have a wallet on Arbitram. There are other ways to bypass that one week even without using a centralized exchange. Fast Bridging projects are alive today.
- Bridges are more secure on L two S to main chain. Rather than having to have an external network of validators, we have the ability to send messages directly from Ethereum to Arbitram. A bridge is only as secure as its least secure partner.
- Everything you see on Arbitrum, literally every app, is completely organic. We have not paid anyone to launch an Arbitram. It's because the belief in the future, the belief that this will be around for a long time. But that doesn't mean that we aren't looking for ways to reinvest in our community.
- Steven: I believe it actually was completely coincidental. We had some sequencer downtime on our end, and I don't believe the timing was suspected. What we're trying to do is basically make sure that people know how to use the backup path. We have a long way to go to our ultimate goal of real full decentralization.
- Seed of Life is a project that was launched by Jump Man. It's one of the first on Chain Life simulating NFTs. The white paper is going to be insane. We just ended our three day lore event. Hopefully this week we have some surprise for you.
- OpenSea and Looks rare are going to be integrating onto Arbitrum. Many people don't talk about how centralized looks rear actually is. Not a single contract was ever audited. They prioritize taking advantage of the market over user security.
- Trove follows the ethos of Treasure and what they stand for and essentially that's as fair as possible. All of these things were distributed through a completely fair process. The amount of teams actually caring about equity distribution like this and organic growth are literally a handful.
- A whole bunch of whitelists that are happening on Arbitram as we speak. They're going to take the Solana NFT market. In order for a project to come on the official Treasure Marketplace, it needs to utilize magic to power the game. We're in for a huge wave, a huge run up.
- Dees: Arbitram is a great platform. Of all the Ll Two S, they and when an EVM compatible ZK roll up comes out, are my favorites. The oldest NFT on Arbitrum is called ARB Empty NFT. There's only 91 left to be minted.
- Small brains are essentially to be looked at as the crypto punks of Arbitram. The punks were nowhere near the first NFT, but they are definitely a catalyst that helped blow up NFTs. They're the first ERC 721. But who's the first 721, though?
- Arbitram has been building a community to explore L Two solutions. 500 people working on spaces, building community, exchanging ideas and discussing it. To see the organic traction on NFTs and these communities building up, it's really exciting.
- First on chain NFT is the Arby bots. Arbitram. I expect a lot of attention to go to Arbitram in the near future. Short term, non financial advice, not financial advice. Do your own research.
- Steven: I love how engaged the community is around Arbitram. I'm really surprised to see more like NFT people get into the DeFi stuff. Steven: Finding community is hard. We should all think we should work as a community.
- Are you guys whitelisted for Battlefly and Peekaboo and some of the upcoming treasure projects I need to be? Just feel free to send over my way anyone in this space who looking to build their own project or integrate with any type of project on Arbitrum.
- There's like 70% tokens right now staked in the Atlas Mine with varying different unlock schedules. Over 50% of those tokens are locked for a year. A lot of our metrics on basing the valuation of magic is using DFI kingdoms juul. It's like a growing community.
- Small brains is like the next crypto punks. I hold a few small brains. Cedar life is undervalued. Thank you for stopping by. See you guys.
- Hunter: Pretty much Arbitram is compatible as an EVM compatible. Just like whatever code you have in Ethereum, you can literally just more or less copy and paste onto Arbitram and you're good to go. I'm definitely going to move up Arbitram in the shadow of the whitelist drops I'm doing for my Todverse collection.
- "I'm staying in Moscow now, so I arranged a hotel near the place. I'm having the meeting tomorrow. That's typical Moscow and I guess New York thing to do to stay in the hotel close to the meeting " If you want to go for another few questions, I'm cool to go.
- "It's crazy. I've been on spaces for almost five and a half hours plus today. And it's like, I'm not even that tired of it, to be honest, " says GM. "It's such a fun process doing it "
- The difference between ZK Syncs, metis, Arbitram and Polygon is really on the technologies that back. These are all different projects with different technologies and different trade offs. We're excited about what we're doing.
- Do you see Arbitrum being able to compete with OpenSea? Treasure is amazing and going to take the NFT world by storm. Arbitrum is a open platform for anyone to build on, in many ways the best players will win.
- Everything you see on Arbitrum today is fully, fully organic. Having this organic, having this heart, this soul, this community, I think that's something that's really hard to replicate. That doesn't mean we won't look for ways to reinvest in our community.
- Treasure Tools is a companion to the treasure ecosystem. It lets builders launch collections that kind of stand out. The most interesting things to me is again, investing in that community. I'm personally collaborating with Jumpman on building out analytics.
