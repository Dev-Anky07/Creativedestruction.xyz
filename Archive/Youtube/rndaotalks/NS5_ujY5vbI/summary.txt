- Jamie Joyce from the society library explains their research process and how they do things at Society Library. The paper and the map for the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant debate. We're talking deliberation decision making libraries of knowledge.
- The Society Library's mission is to improve humanity's relationship to information. One of the most complex things that we do is build debate maps, which also serve as libraries. We want to move our political decision making models into more of a digital congress.
- The Society Library Papers is a database of arguments surrounding nuclear power. It breaks down arguments into economic, environmental and safety categories. These debate maps can go down extremely far.
- Just to give you more context. The quote from which the claim was derived. Relationship to other claims. This is like our first push out of this kind of front end. But I'm going to pause and see if I've made sense at all.
- In order to overcome the infinite recursion, we use clone which clones the top node. But that means that the other node that we copy is not going to recognize that this clone is a copy. It's hard to explain, but essentially we have accommodated for that in the data structure.
- A linked knowledge web is something that I think people could really benefit from. Chain of providence, evidence linked to claims. This is the inevitable evolution of where information should go in a digital age. Society Library is doing this manually, mostly just to prove like it can be done.
- The Society Library is a 501 nonprofit organization, and we give away this data for free. We're trying to get people to imagine what a new digital public library could be. Our goal is just we'll save you 10,000 hours of research if you want to learn about this subject.
- The Society Library is deceptively a tiny nonprofit. How is it funded? And then how do you expand it out to a large population? Would a new search engine like Tempest be a good partner for this?
- The Society Library is not to invest in building its own audience. Its strategy is to work with the people who already have audiences and improve their knowledge output. The nonprofit is also interested in partnering with search engines.
- How do we create these debate maps? There's hundreds of different debate mapping platforms out there. How did we find this system that can accommodate enough complexity without being too academic and overwhelming? And how do we get people to actually produce this?
- There's various different ways in which we assess accuracy. The Society library is never going to tell anyone what's true or not true. All we do is contextualize by argumentation. When someone decides in their own mind that something is true, it's a heuristic of their own.
- The process begins with archival methods. We begin extracting and categorizing claims and arguments. Once we have all of these different topics, we create something that we call an archive catalog. There's a variety of different things we do to make sure that we're comprehensive.
- The Society library breaks down complex social and political issues into claims and evidence. We are rigorous about pulling out as much meaning as possible from natural language. We take highly contentious, we go after the impactful, persistent polarizing issues.
- How do you know? You come up with a good question. It kind of reveals itself in the data. So it's literally the cleanliness of the data clicking into place. It's a big, complex way of answering question.
- Did the initial question of the Diabol Canyon map was updated recently? And it proves kind of the point that you were making, which was that you have to do the mapping to come up with the right question. That does change over time.
- In the current interface, it can imply that some arguments are more popular than others. We're always going to be working on iterating more and making it less biased in terms of its visual representation. And then for the impacts and truth scores, which we need to change immediately.
- Is the training that you do open source? It will be. We're going to be taking a lot of our methods and bringing it to the fact checkers. Some of the techniques that we took ideas from was the 2009 CIA, trader primecraft.
- In the meantime, anybody else has questions for Jamie and this wonderfully in depth presentation that she gave about the process. Now that we've completed and published our first collection, now we're focused on how much of this can we automate. Everybody can donate to the Society library to fund their efforts.
- And if there's no more questions, let's wrap this up. We will have more events coming soon, and so you can follow now and join the discord. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure.
