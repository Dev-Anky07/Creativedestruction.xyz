- Hello, everybody. Welcome to the spaces. Just be a little patient with us while we get some of the speakers and co hosts up. Appreciate your patience.
- Today is just a combo space with the Apecoms crew and the ladies of Buc crew. What we want to do is pull up just the marketing communications candidates first up on stage. And we'll come to the metaverse after we've done this section.
- Apecons and ladies of BYC are an informal group of highly motivated and active members of the apecoin community. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. We are simply providing a channel to share information within our community.
- SSP: You have five minutes to please give us a rundown of what the Markom's role is. Adventurous and Tiger have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. If you can go ahead and invite the rest of your networks, like repost, say, GM or GN bookmark.
- The Marketing Communications Working Group was voted in in June, July of this year. The group's mandate is to set up the infrastructure for marketing communications in 2024. The goal is to come out with a roadmap and then submit it for approval in February or March.
- The elections for the first round of votes for marketing comms and Metaverse Stewards just went live tonight. We're doing the election for the Secondary Citizen secondary apes of the ones, not the First Class special Council members. Tiger and Adventure Say put an agenda together for us. And we got some questions.
- We're going to go with Lorelord first. Peak lord. Popple snowflake and Toby. Each will have two minutes to make a quick introduction of your just background and your bio.
- "I'm running for the Marco and Stewart role. My vision is to create a narrative for the Apecoin Dow. I really live and breathe blockchain. I think that stepping with this role we will have the chance to onboard more people new community members "
- Poppy is the ex committee manager at Open Scene. She is also the founder of A Boy Tea. She wants to support make by A and boyip into the ecosystem. Snowflake, your two minutes please.
- In his five years in Apple, during three years I covered several regions. I'm artist in VR, three D and other art. I really want to expand across the regions and help everybody. Don't be just focused on specific languages in one region.
- We have our last nominee coming up. We have Toby. Your two minutes starts right you. If you'd like to just share in your comments, like some of the great campaign pieces you've been sharing, just drop in the comments.
- So now we're going to go into the questions loss. Are you able to just briefly read through all the questions. Then each nominee will have five minutes to summarize some of these points. If one of them is too difficult, just let us know and we'll probably give you a pass.
- Apecoin dow Mark Homs is more inclusive to all languages. What social media platform would you utilize to promote the Dao and grow its presence? Do you have any examples of marketing strategies that could be effective to get the dow reaching out to a larger audience?
- Nominees have five minutes to give their vision for the job. Lorlord, Tiger, and Machu give their visions. Did he miss any of the questions?
- Tiger: I truly believe in the power of the effective communication. My goal is to empower our community and try to create with this dow a beacon. Budget is a really tricky question because at the end it's something new for us.
- Popple: I'm seeing more and more Acorn creators getting attention into the Akon Dao. I want to bring that skill set to the ACON Dao to improve the IP ecosystem for ACON as well. And also the most meme point I do want to cover the Asia user.
- I speak more than four languages, so that's helpful, right? Like, all native. What's the vision of marketing? Communication working group. How would you ensure the VG is effective? This is voter decision.
- Toby's vision for Apecoin is for it to get the attention and spotlight that it deserves. This also means being more inclusive to non English speakers. The first two months will be very critical where we're going to be building the 2024 plan.
- The budget would be less than 1% of our holdings. Most companies do 25% of the revenue they have. Where the the most community support is going to be needed is getting that budget passed 100%.
- Apt. 246 is the working group charter for marketing and communications. You'll have the entire week up until next Wednesday, 06:00 p. m. PST to get your votes in for any of these nominees. Five will carry on to become candidates in a final election.
- And thank you SSP for joining us. Everything I say is just to make sure you guys are still awake out here. Yes, I do have bankers hours. And I'll stick around, but I might be sleeping. Good night.
- AIP 245 is the working group charter for the Metaverse. If you go to the website discussions that'll lead you to our forum, AIP 245. Just click the little magnifying glass. You don't even need to be logged in.
- Wabam is one of the members of the Apecoin Special Council. The mandate and scope is supporting content creators and builders in The Other Side. Also facilitating Ape coin adoption in the Metaverse beyond The Other side. Before Wabam gets started, can I ask the Marketing and Comms nominees to please step down and go into Listener.
- There are some really amazing people running to be a steward of this Metaverse Working Group. The mandate would be to support content creators and builders on the other side, facilitate ape adoption in other Metaverses. It's got a huge potential and there's a wide scope for people to build it as they see fit.
- Wabaum: What you have is really only limited by what your imagination and vision is for this working group and for what is the future of Ape in the Metaverse. Working groups are independent, autonomous entities. It's not the role of the Ape Foundation to tell working groups what to do.
- And with that, we want to welcome you guys up here. I saw David down in the audience as well. David, I know you're supposed to be up here with us. Sent you a couple invites, maybe not working, send us a request.
- Sad fez ape. Should I call you board? Or do you prefer to go by something else? Board. I chose the name on May 1, 2021. It's a long name, but it's, I guess okay.
- I believe in the MetaWars. Some market estimates are about 100 billion of market capitalization in the next few years. The priority for this working group should be fully support what is going to come out of the other side. We should be also reaching out to other metaverses that are emerging around.
- We will ask these questions just a little bit differently than we did in the previous round. We don't expect all of the nominees to necessarily be experts at marketing and communications. And we will still just keep that five minute timer.
- Sad Fez Ape: I'm really excited to be a part of the emerging metaverses. If I'm elected, I will be working with the work group members to cooperate on a strategy to engage the other side. We should make it as a success for the success of the community and success of Apecoin.
- What type of initiatives do you hope to support? I know you spoke about collaborating sort of directly with yuga. The priority should be experiment within the other side first. We should fully support the launch of it and everything will come.
- The difference is going to be that in other Side and similar meta verses, we are going to own the assets. We are already there, but it will emerge, it will change in nature. This is just going to grow as other side and as the Ape community. We should definitely be the ones who define how it's going to move forward.
- If possible, I would invite the members. Let's meet up in real life. Sit around the table, have some drinks, discuss, have a whiteboard and discuss our strategy together before taking on individual initiatives. It should focus on the other side first and then we will move on.
- How would you imagine putting a team together to support this vision and how do you imagine supporting them in executing the vision? We'll definitely reach out to the Ape community first.
- What makes the Metaverse Working Group worth being funded by the Dow? It will depend on the initiatives. Let's create ideas, devise plans and then ask for funding. If the Ape community believes that it is useful, it will get funded. If not, so we'll iterate more.
- How would you ensure that the group stays effective and accountable? I believe we should have a regular schedule of meetings and meeting minutes and then share it with the community. The transparency is important.
- Tiger, what was that second sound? How much longer do we have after that funky sound? We had David, but I think he's having some trouble connecting right now. If he's able to join us, we'll try to add him last. We should move on to our next guest.
- Tiger waves for 30 seconds. When you clap, it's over. Vancouver, baby. Right up the coast from you, I believe. I am reasonably doxed and probably will do a lot more so if I'm elected. Love it.
- G: What inspired you to run for the stewardship of the Metaverse working group? He says his passion for creating immersive worlds, really, that's his background in motion pictures. We've got a bunch of questions, and we're keeping it to five minutes.
- The metaverse is an interconnected universe of virtual spaces where physical and digital realms merge. It includes digital or sorry, dynamic, user driven environments, augmented reality, immersive spaces. The emphasis is on creating metaverse experiences that not only enrich user interaction, but strategically contribute to raising the value of the Apecoin token.
- What makes the Metaverse Working Group worth being funded for? UG. Well, I think the worth lies in its potential to position Apecoin right, as, like, a front runner in the metaverse space or the cultural token. That makes it a strategic investment for the Dow.
- What sort of a budget do you think is going to be needed here for the Metaverse Working Group? $1 million? Well, no, I wouldn't get into specifics. But I would propose a flexible budget initially, let's allocate resources for foundational infrastructure.
- What sort of initiatives do you hope to support? Well, I think it's a digital universe. I would say, again, focusing on the builder tool layers. The charter needs revisiting, and then I would do that as part of a discussion.
- Next on the list, I think we have David that came up. Let's get David in here with us. What I will do in the coming future. I think I will focusing on appcoin mass adoption. Trying to bring more builders and projects into RFID.
- Tiger should do this interview. I feel like it's a special request we got to grant it. Sure we do it for the people. Right.
- What kind of budget do you think is needed to pursue this vision? I think we need to think over every project that we put into the priest should come out with outcome. How to charge front list is a bigger question.
- How would you ensure that the working group is effective and accountable? As we know it's really a new position so everything is new. Most important thing is that for working group we could put enough time on building this kind of thing.
- David: What is your definition of a metaverse and what does it include? I think Metaverse is something that in the coming future is a combination of social fi and GameFi. David, thank you so much for your answers.
-  Adventuresaves will take over for the rest of these interviews. Who's up next? Then it's snowflake. Snowflake, welcome back up.
- What inspired you to run for Metaverse Steward? There was some developments in VR that I really loved and I participated. We have several games where you can use your Ape avatar. I'm still waiting for approval on the Apecoin proposal for skins.
- Snowflake, you only asked me one question. The other guys, we were all limited by five minutes. I couldn't respond to the rest of you. Let's move on to our next guest.
- Yeah, so, unfortunately, we do have to go on to the next guest. Adventuresafe is doing the rest of these interviews, or I'm fired. If you don't mind, I could just run through it. It'll be quicker.
- Michael Padilla is the founder and CEO of a championship esports and gaming entertainment company called Congana. Has over a decade of professional experience in the gaming and Web Three industries. Will lead and develop the Apecoin Dow's creator program. If you really want to ask him the questions, he can run through them quickly.
- Apecoin Dow needs to be a premier power player in the Metaverse and gaming worlds. What makes it worth being funded by the Dow? Check out my nomination post to learn more.
- Up next is Trader Blue. What inspired you to run for Metaverse Steward? I really want to focus on our content creators. It's going to be easy to create content there, so we need to have our foot in the door.
- We need to have smart metrics. We need to create measured goals. We must execute as best as we can. The metaverse is going to be a huge place. We really need to whittle it down at first and see how we can get more attention to the dow itself.
- Do you have goals in mind that you would set? Of course. I think our first initiative is to definitely put out a statement on what we're actually doing for the Dao and how we're going to help the Dow. Goal number two, the outreach starts.
- The Dao is such a large endeavor that I think that people are stretched too thin. I think we need a certain focus group on certain aspects of the community. The metaverse is truly a change in how we view the world. What budget do you think is needed to see through this vision?
- We have our last guest today, our last nominee. He is also going by Metasailer. Adventurous will ask you a few questions. Do you want to just do a quick I think this might be your first space speaking with the rest of the Dow.
- I am a computer scientist, a founder, an investor, and also a board member. We're very excited to bring Asia to the table for building global metaverse spaces. Having a store where Apecoin starts being relevant at the biggest gaming level is how we're going to drive adoption.
- We are going to shorten your questionnaire a little bit to about three minutes and 30 seconds. We're going to let adventurous ask you some of the questions. So with that, I'll hand over the floor to Adventure.
- "I want to be part of that transformation effort with all of the amazing people here, " says Apecoin founder. He is running for Metaverse Steward, hoping to create a settlement currency for the metaverse. How do you think you can execute this vision? There are three pieces to it.
- Working group stewards and also marketing and comms working group stewards. Each category has two seats available as of today. Round one is weighted, meaning per wallet. Second round where it's one wallet per vote.
- The Metaverse steward nominees and potential candidates are out here. There are also AIPS up for vote. We're going to be announcing some stuff this week in support of the election coverage. If you have any questions, if you can't reach them, send us a message.
