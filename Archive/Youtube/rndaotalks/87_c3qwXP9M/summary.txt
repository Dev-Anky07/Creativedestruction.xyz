- Matt Freeman is an international trafficking human expert with over 30 years of experience in this area. Currently he's the CEO of the Mekong Club, which is an association of Asian businesses that have come together to fight human trafficking. You're welcome to comment and start chatting using the chat.
- There are 4.8 million women and girls in forced prostitution around the world. Matt Welch: I'm going to be talking about human trafficking, modern slavery, but with an emphasis on the private sector. Welch: How would you apply it to your world?
- A Cambodian boy, 15 years old, is told by his family to go to Thailand and get a job. He ends up working 16, 1718, 19 hours a day, every day. If he doesn't, he gets beaten and tortured. This is another example of human trafficking.
- Another form of human trafficking. There are more slaves today than any other time in history. In a single day, 25 200 people enter into modern slavery somewhere in the world. We have to be part of the solution to modern slavery.
- Most governments don't like to admit the fact that they have slaves. The groups that are really doing most of the work are the non government organizations. Out of 40 million people, 75% in forced labor, 60% of them associated with supply chains. Another group that has to be involved in helping to address this the private sector.
- Modern slavery is the second largest transnational crime in the world. The amount of money available to address this is about $350,000,000. Most people don't know about this issue. The counter trafficking world hasn't done a good enough job of raising awareness.
- The first trend that we see is legislation. Another thing we're seeing is major lawsuits against companies. The new movement, the new developmental topic is modern slavery. Expect to see more and more coverage on this, more interest in this.
- Companies are developing policies that basically say they have zero tolerance related to human trafficking. The types of things auditors are looking at that are considered to be indicators of modern slavery. Big brands don't allow factories to have any indebtedness because it becomes a risk for them.
- $150,000,000.000 is generated from modern slavery. If any of that money gets into a legitimate bank, it's money laundering. A lot of banks are doing everything they can to ensure that no dirty money makes into the bank.
- Maycon club works with the private sector in a positive, supportive, non naming and shaming way to help them understand the issue of modern slavery. We work with the hospitality sector, the banks, the retailers, the tech world, with the construction world, anyone and everyone who has a potential risk.
- CNN's John Avlon talks about what the world needs to do to address modern slavery. He says if everyone could do at least one thing a year, that would add up. Avlon: You can volunteer. You can be responsible consumers. Small contributions can make a big deal.
- A lot of people think that the private sector are inherently evil when it comes to this. But I think they're actually heroic. I have a couple of books out that we sell and proceeds go to charity.
- Matt: If you'd like to ask a question, you can either put it in the chat or use the reactions button. One of them was around recruitment fees, and this is partially a parody. The other thing got me to think about I'm not a developer working in an industry that is tech driven.
- Sandy Scalani is the Director of Voices for Florida, which is Florida's largest network of providers for services to child and youth sex trafficking victims. His research is looking at forward thinking uses of blockchain for supply chain transparency. How do we develop the decentralized space and crypto space to ensure that people aren't being exploited?
- One thing I've kind of been into as well is having various basically rating systems and metrics. Could blacklist certain addresses that are suspected of human trafficking or stuff like that. Could be automated too to make sure that those addresses don't interact with different protocols.
- Maggie: I couldn't avoid thinking about the parallel between some of the situations that Maggie described and the default way that most DAOs engage with contributors. She says we should reevaluate the whole bounty system and not make it the default system. Maggie: A new type of trafficking is happening in Southeast Asia.
- All right, well, thank you, everyone, so much for attending. For anyone interested, I shared the link to Dao. We can also continue the conversation there or on Twitter and look forward to seeing you in the next one.
