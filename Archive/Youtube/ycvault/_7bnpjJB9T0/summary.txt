- YC would love for you to consider working at a YC startup. Seed, as we talk about it is typically pre product, right? They don't have a product. We'll talk about what it means to do a safe and an unpriced round and angel investors.
- It is correlated, and not always definitely correlated with having Product Market Fit. Next is growth. It's really just market expansion. And then the last stage that we talk about is scale. Hiring for everything and lots of specialization.
- YC founder: Make something people want, talk to users, and do things that don't scale. If you have questions, definitely shoot it in the chat and I'll see if I can circle back.
- If you are starting at an early stage company like Airbnb, you are doing things that are not scalable. Why do things that don't scale? That's a great question. I would be wary of companies that are super early looking for PMS roles.
- At seed stage startups, we're finding that base salary can come to 80% to 90% of Fang. In a rare case where it's almost like your co founder, you should expect stock options. When you get stock options, it's the option to buy into the value of the company.
- Why not join an early stage startup? You need financial security, ownership and trust. If you hate uncertainty, then early stage C, stage startups might not be for you. People want an outsized impact.
- You should be asking co founders, like, what their experience is, what's their magic abilities. These are questions to ask at seed stage companies. Use these questions to evaluate the founders and whether or not you want to work there.
- A lot of these companies that are having layoffs have not been looking at their runway and burn rate. What you're really asking is how does the founder think about this as a solid business. You want to be as full transparency from the founders and if they're not giving that to you, you should have cause for concern.
- What can I learn by working here and working with you? Ideally, we all want to be learning stuff on the job. How many years of experience are YC and non YC startups looking for within DS and ML roles for early early stage.
- In series A, is like product, market, fit. It's somewhere in this space where either you have it or you're right before having it. Be sure that when you're asking who are your customers, what's your burn rate?
- Early stage startup salespeople have a really good insight of product. Your early hires are going to be all engineers to build a thing. Go to market experts, recruiting, maybe specialists, maybe customer support. That's where you start hiring.
- All right, compensation. Again, it's about 80% to 90% of base salary. You're still doing stock options if you do the math. We have a number of Series A companies in our portfolio. You can use the tool like you saw before.
- Going a bit into growth, which we just talk about as a lump beyond Series A. One of the indications of whether or not there's a company seeing growth. Ask around funding, burn rate, runway, a lot of times the companies will just tell you this because they want you to join.
- At a growth stage company, it's 50 to 500 people. Fit startups have made something people want. But they are at this point where they do things that don't scale. They're trying to scale by adding more people. The information is there for you to find on your own product market.
- How early is too early for recruiting? Certainly at growth companies. How much money have they raised? What is their headcount plan? Is it realistic for them to grow? And is your background relevant to the things that they want?
- The upside for VC is not really there as much as a hedge fund evaluation. You should expect the equity to be at the public market. If you can get paid what it feels reasonable from a base amount, and get a lot of equity in a company, and it grows with each successive round, your stock is worth something.
- Scale is like 500 plus people, thousands hiring for all roles. They're thinking about international. And you'll also find, just as you will with fang companies, deep specialization. And obviously public companies. Instacart probably is looking to IPO sometime.
- Startups versus large companies. Why would you want to work at one versus the other? Biggest difference is, again, generalist and specialists, early stage companies. People pick smaller companies because they feel they have more ownership and impact.
