- Welcome to this deep democracy session. I only have 1 hour to introduce Deep Democracy. It's a mindset of philosophy and a facilitation technique. A general introduction course might take you up to a day. Full level training takes you.
- Deep Democracy has a tradition to open with an inclusive welcome board. And I created one for you today, so I'm going to read it to you. An inclusive warm welcome to set the space and the container for today.
- Deep Democracy invites you to welcome something that is not so nice. What do you welcome today? What feeling, what is alive? We can do a mini round and whoever feels like going first can go first.
- I'm ramping up as the autumn and winter comes. The polarity between wanting to slow down, but actually it's like you're speeding up. What do you welcome as a feeling? Feeling depressed a little bit because of the winter.
- Deep Democracy is a philosophy and a mindset, and it has a toolbox for facilitation of groups. The bottom line of deep democracy is that we always listen into the no voice. Growing awareness will probably become your biggest advantage and your biggest opportunity to start working in the group.
- Imagine that you live in a town ruled by an autocrat dictator mayor. He tells you that the only way to communicate in this town is to use Twitter. How would you react? What would you do?
- First instinct is to just leave. There's too many options. If you know too many places that are fair, please take me as well. Manuel, Tyler or Maria. Any voices, anything, how would you react?
- In fractals, it's not the same as you having a potato king or Elon Musk saying Twitter. If a decision doesn't land on you like you want it to land, or if you don't feel hurt in the decision, all these sabotage feelings that you feel right now, I'm leaving. Deep Democracy is advocating for listening to the no voices.
- Deep Democracy has a decision making model that is based on consent making. Similar to sociocracy way of making decisions, but it also works with consent. In five steps, you have debates, and we're going to do one now. It's a whole toolbox of 40 tools.
- Could you please share that slideshow on the chat box, please? Is that okay? Of course. When I stop sharing, I'll definitely do that, for sure.
- It's a big alarm when groups do not make a decision. We are right there, right now, in our dao regions, unite very much on finance. We keep circling and nobody dares to take the decision. This is the exact point where you feel like there's stuff under the waterline that's not being said.
-  debating in deep democracy is just a little bit different than a regular debate. What you say can just be as right as what another person says. We do this because we want to stay connected. It's an invitation for being authentic. But it's also creating trust.
- "I've never been able to shut up. It has always been counterproductive, " he says. What would be all your reasons to speak up in a group? Let's first do our rounds on that for two, three minutes.
- Daniel for me, it would be to inspire others to speak, right? I'm usually the one that'll jump off the cliff first. Every now and then I'll throw out an idea that might be contrarian. I think contrarian ideas help people think differently.
- A lot of speaking also comes down to some of the cultural values and beliefs. In the end, it's about being effective. Sometimes it's the most effective thing to do to come to a decision to speak up.
- Priya: Is there anything that touched you in a way that was surprising, something that you learned? Everything in an organization is relationships. The more authentic you can relate right, the more powerful your organization becomes. This was a brief intro into Deep Democracy.
- Are we not assuming that people are capable of acknowledging the mistakes in their opinion and going back and changing them? What if the stakes are so high, for example, if there is a financial motivation to remain false? How does it affect this practice?
