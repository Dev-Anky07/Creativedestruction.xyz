- You must be enjoying this music too much. I'm definitely enjoying, actually enjoying that music. Good morning. Good afternoon, good evening. Welcome.
- Irvin: I would love to have a session from Apecons just on Ape chain. He says there needs to be a more well informed discussion. Irvin: If you want to know, tell these people, come to Apecoms on a Friday.
- Four teams are interested in approaching the Dow to talk about what they're working on. If we could all do it together collectively somehow, I'd love to see it. G would love to be part of it.
- Gabe: I want to provide a safe space for people to have a discussion. What they often need is just a set of questions that they can prepare for. He says AIP 41 should be reverted. There needs to be a core differentiator if we're going to become a quote unquote gaming chain.
- On 41, it does say that apecoin would remain in Ethereum or an L two scaling solution secured by Ethereum. But it says it doesn't preclude subsequent AIPs from suggesting a move to another chain. There is only technically three month period for confliction with any proposal.
- There are pending proposals posted, so you can check those out as well. You could start reading, start preparing for voting for next week. All right, have a nice weekend everybody.
