- Mic check. How am I sounding? Sounding great. Nice to meet you. Ellie or Eli. Or Ellie. Eli. Okay. We got Billy here, we got Vansh, and we have folks. Thank you.
- Vansha is a Dev advocate for API Three. Ashar is our ecosystem lead. Vanch is our integrations engineer. If you guys want to give a short introduction to your day to day at API Three, go for it.
-  API Three is like real world data for Web Three straight from the source. Key learning points today is going to be learning about chain API plus air node. Also discussing our DAPI price feeds, which is always available on chain at every second.
- Anode is a serverless oracle that is developed by the API three dow. It sources the data directly from the data provider without having to go through a middleman. To deploy an anode on chain, you can deploy it on any cloud providers. Today we are going to deploy our own Anode on AWS.
- So we have successfully integrated the is the this is the integration that we did. You can now select all the chains that you would want to deploy on. Authorizers are basically access controls for your notes. Is it the same process when they do it through Sepolia?
- The first step is to create the sponsor wallet. It's how we'll generate future wallets to sponsor for somewhat like a relayer for gas. To deploy it, you can populate all the env files quickly. It would take some time to deploy, probably like five to six minutes.
- For our demo, we're creating a fun little game of how can we gamify this YouTube stream. We're creating kind of like a prediction market where how many views would this live stream get? Right? And so for our scope, I'm creating different options.
- So we've requested the data, now we are receiving. We're deleting the request and then we're decoding the data. And then I am setting that decoded data to that return response. So pretty straightforward.
- How long would you say from start to finish? Setting up a smart contract like this would be for someone who has practiced it a few times. With the logic already in place, you could probably get away with 90 minutes.
- Smart contracts can be used for bookmaking, royalties and social media. There is no grace period or control for people to place last minute bets. What's the most creative way you've seen someone use one of these?
- We're going to fulfill our entire list of requests. The thing I always forget to do all the time is to fund it. Can these API smart contracts get pretty expensive if it's being used for a very high traffic event?
- Billy, you were at ETH Global, right? That's how I got the Arbitram tee that I'm wearing today. I actually hung out with quite a few people in Arbitram with James from the prison team. I'm just making sure that we're good on time because we're going to have probably some questions after.
- Anyone can grab the proxy contract address and just use it, right? And this is funded up to five years roughly right now. The whole chain can then use it indefinitely until the managed funding runs out, which is expiring November 2023 this year.
- Building a smart contract on Chain, creating like, a little bit of a prediction market of how many views it'll get. And then playing the winners on all, in a trustless manner as we go. Here's how the API works.
-  API Three workshop coming up in London. Challenge for API Three is to fork this repo and rebuild it with a specific live stream on YouTube. Best Async would be on the Discord on there. Big bounty for ETH London coming up.
- Billy: Just the structure breakdown is kind of the best way. That's why I kind of broke it down. Really makes a lot of great things. When you look at it like the whole thing at once, it's overwhelming. But the breakdowns are helpful.
- A question that came in the community was how would you implement this in a gaming context. One cool thing I've seen is a betting platform between two players to bet with an escrow. And then random numbers are definitely games. Maybe another day we'll demo that for random number.
- Awesome. All right, thank you everyone for thank you, everyone, for joining and being patient and watching us cook live with some coding and enjoy the rest of your work week. Catch you later.
