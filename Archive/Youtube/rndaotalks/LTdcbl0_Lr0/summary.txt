- Today we'll be talking with Joshua. He's the author of Blockchain Radicals how Capitalism Ruined Crypto and how to Fix It. Thanks again for having me.
- Daniel has a blog and a podcast called The Blockchain Socialist. I explore the intersection of crypto and left wing politics. I wrote a book called Blockchain Radicals how Capitalism Ruined Crypto and how to Fix It. Here he explains his conceptual framework for some of the ideas in the book.
- Author: Representational thinking is endemic in crypto, that it's all over the place. We're constantly putting using representational models to kind of understand what this new thing of crypto is. It restricts the way that people think about crypto because they're thinking about it in an ideological frame.
- In the book I kind of go through the three most common in a chronological order of representational models that people kind of think about crypto through. But I think it's important to note that kind of like all models are wrong but some are useful.
- The way that we think about the internet changed quite a lot from when it was first introduced in the 80s or 90s. I think we're long overdue for very new ways to interact with the internet. A lot of people are interested in Web Three for, because they say they want the Internet to be fun again.
- We often think of technical and social relationships as separate. But you cannot separate them. No matter if you are a builder of a technical infrastructure, you are facilitating a particular social relationship through that technical infrastructure. This facilitates different social relationships and therefore different material outcomes.
- When we look at wage inequality in traditional companies versus cooperatives, there's a huge difference. The current digital infrastructure in which we are kind of reliant on is one that is very centrally owned. The North Star for people in crypto is to build collectively owned digital infrastructure.
- Bob Greene: What sort of representation models do you think you would suggest for crypto? He says the cooperative space is one where you can learn a lot from. Greene: Another one is looking into credit clearing and things like this.
- Social provisioning means a socialist organization provisioning the requirements of life for all of its citizens. I think there is generally, of course, people lean on kind of like market oriented thinking about provisioning. With the big bear market, I find that a lot of people are thinking that something needs to change if Crypto is to survive.
-  crypto world has this kind of fetishization of exchange value of like I'm getting something because I can then exchange it for something more. I wonder if there comes a tipping point where everything is so financialized that it's completely unescapable.
- Blockchains are peer to peer at the node level. Have you considered alternative mechanisms for coordination? Holochain takes a different approach in which they're not a blockchain. Very local consensus is also a lot faster.
- Joshua: We were frustrated with the network states. The idea is less about how do we create a new state for our utopia. Our idea is that we need to use decentralized technologies to augment how people relate with one another. We're questioning whether or not we should be thinking of this through a nation state.
- Joshua: Maybe you could talk about where you see kind of the balance of an opt out approach and kind of like a community stewardship approach. You also mentioned like augmented bonding curves and stuff like the idea like burning or rage quitting. Very interesting call, guys.
