- Stephen Kohn: Arbitrum grew out of Princeton University. His early work focused on securing digital assets and the cryptography of cryptocurrencies. He says the idea for off chain labs predates ethereum. Kohn says Arbitram is focused on layer two scaling solutions for ethereum mainnet.
- Ed Felton is the co founder and chief scientist, harry Kelvner is chief technology officer, and Stephen is the CEO and co founder Off Chain Labs. It was Ed who really began Arbitram, and I only got involved. When Ed came back in 2017, that was really when we picked it up again.
- The base layer would be synonymous with the settlement layer. Would you kind of agree with that? There's a lot of different terms that people use. If you derive your security from the layer one with none or minimal additional assumptions, then you're basically considered a layer two.
-  layer two solutions are able to do things that are impossible on layer one. By lowering the fees, we're making things just a whole lot better for a lot of users. Many users that were previously priced out can now participate and enjoy the same benefits.
- There are things that are just simply too expensive to do on Ethereum today that we can do on Arbitram. And then there's other applications that are made possible because of the faster speed that we do for transactions. Another place where that's important is there's a really, really exciting gaming ecosystem that's beginning to form.
- A project's decision to build on layer two is not solely based on the technological implementation. It's kind of like the network effect of all the projects and users that are already on the layer two solution. Most important part of our ecosystem are the users.
- The most important thing that I would try to hone in on is the security aspect. We think it's critically important to scale without sacrificing the security of Ethereum. The importance of onboarding is also a big part of user experience. We really try to create the most welcoming ecosystem for everyone.
- Two main layer two approaches. One is optimistic roll up and the other is the ZK roll up, the zero knowledge proof. Can you please discuss the differences as they relate to transaction costs, security, developer adoption and interoperability?
- The unifying factor that really unites all roll ups is proofs. They differ in how they prove to Ethereum that things are correct. ZK rollups do something called validity proofs. Optimistically. We don't actually include any proof at all.
- Arbitrum really, really shines that we have full EVM compatibility. We have very, very low cost of operating a node for ZK rollups. Our belief firmly is that ZK Roll ups will be much, much more expensive long term than optimistic roll ups.
- When it comes to security, they really both derive their security from Ethereum. In the case of a ZK roll up, they prove to Ethereum and Ethereum directly verifies the proof. There's always implementation details and are there implementation bugs?
- Ethereum is moving to a consensus mechanism called proof of Stake from Proof of work. There are over 300,000 active Validators on the Beacon chain with close to 10 million e. My question to you is with the merge coming soon, does it pose any risk to existing projects building on Arbitrum?
- Vitalik Buterin praised Arbitram in the Discord channel by saying, you guys are a central part of the solution. The Arbitram team has a great relationship with the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik. Arbitrum is open up to every bridge that wants to launch an Arbitrum.
