- In 1930, John Maynard Keys predicted that by the century's end, technology would have advanced sufficiently so that people wouldn't have to work 40 hours weeks. Yet our work hasn't reduced. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are effectively pointless.

- Survey: More than half of the working hours in American offices are spent on BS. The amount of time the average American office worker says they're devoted to their actual duty has declined from 46% in 2015 to 39% in 2016. Finding meaning in your work is a first world problem.
- The first thing that I've noticed in losing my corporate job and taking on work for myself is the lack of meetings. A corporate job can make it impossible to have any deep work in your day. A great activity that recently has been contributing to meaning in my life is cooking.

- You might want to consider saying no to rising up the corporate ladder. When you're actually involved in the work, that's where satisfaction comes from. But BS jobs are probably here to stay. For those who are willing to chase fulfillment while making the dough, I say greatness is coming.
