- Welcome to the Apecoin AIP roundup. Number 55. And we have five proposals up for vote. You guys got till Wednesday to get your votes in for these ones. There will still be plenty of room for other people to join us up here. Feel free, send requests.
- It's encouragement versus support. We want to encourage people to submit their ideas. Ultimately, when it comes time to support people in whatever way that means, the conversation changes. It goes from that encouragement to was there feedback provided? Was that feedback applied?
- Aaron: Is there a way that you can structure it a little bit more like a loyalty program. Should a board ape or a mutant holder with no ape coin get the same benefit funded by apecoin as an apecoin token holder? My view is we need to shift not to give up benefits to Yuga asset holders.
- The original benefit of the Apecoin and the Dow was for apes and mutants. Mochaverse NFT holders would also want to be treated well. That's one of the reasons why going back to all City said 50,000 bottles, that covers everyone.
- In other communities, there's a threshold for even submitting proposals. At the Apecoin Dow, you need to have two nouns in order to submit a proposal. Let's talk about comedy.
- Join Lord Lord today. Set your alarm. Don't forget to get those votes in SSP. Tonight, chaos and Mayhem. It's going to be there.
