- GM kind of transcends the actual definition it initially was. It doesn't even mean good morning anymore. It's kind of just like I like, right, we're here with Battle Plan.
-  Pixel Vault launched in May of 2021 with Punks Comic. The company is working toward the launch of the Reboot Protocol. Battle Plan is the initial crown jewel of what we look to be a fully decentralized arcade.
- My particular interest is I like games that have risk. I love games that test people's capacity for risky and lossy behavior. How can you trustlessly play games with people, maintain a common state, but play games that has real value at stake?
- Fell into the perfect intersection of crypto NFTs gaming in Pixel Vault. The community play test thus far has been spectacular. For me, I'm a huge proponent of leading with fun first games. I definitely believe good game design works with good creative gamers.
- There's a lot of different ways to interact with Web Three with gaming. Now we're starting to see a lot more indie gaming. AAA game at web three speed is tough to navigate. You got to take it one a at a time.
- It's a three V, three auto brawler, kind of along the lines of an auto chess style game. Very strategic, front, heavy. You tee up your brawlers with a combination of skills. There's a lot of exciting stuff going on just on this screen.
- Battle Plan is modeled off of Mobile game that's really popular for years. It is matchmaking you based on an on chain MMR based rating. There are over 10,000 generative NFTs in the Inhabitants collection that will be playable characters. Right now we're featuring only nine of the cores in this current alpha.
- All of the character traits and all of the characters are hand drawn, hand animated. Tip Mouse helped with a completely custom, kind of like, animation pipeline.
- Aaron mentioned the rest of the generative identities that will eventually be incorporated as characters in the game. Any combination of any generative identity that could possibly exist or be minted can eventually be rendered. You can only earn them through our Battle Pass, which you can unlock stuff by winning battles.
- Reboot's matchmaking system is intermittent. It's more of a queue system every battle, but in the same existing instance of the game. Players are getting into the minutiae of not only what their build is, but also who they may be matched against.
- The idea is to win the most up to 15 rounds before you lose five lives. There are instances where winning slightly more than you lose can still net you a positive outcome. The rewards tracks through the battle pass.
- The protocol is completely on chain protocol, so all player data, including their ratings information, is completely public. The planets that you play on per session are randomly chosen. If you pick a brawler where their planet of origin matches, you actually get a point bonus for every win.
- That was my next question. What part of this system is on Arbitrum? All of it. Wait, you still have one more heart. One more. I'm honestly getting my butt kicked, but we can run it back a little more.
- Everything the back office is all on Arbitrum Nova. Players connect with a mainnet ETH wallet and sign one kind of a session key. Everything gets relayed gasless through Arbitram Nova. This is a pay to win or win to earn protocol is what we call it.
- Web Three is a massively multiplayer competition. There's a common prize pool everyone's competing for that's managed through Arbitram Nova. Season two kicks off with a new prize pool. People are having to craft new strategies to counter the existing meta.
- The depth and complexity definitely is what keeps me coming back. The difference here, also from other Auto Battlers, is you're leveling up the character instead of choosing to roll. And we're already seeing some of the community that's been play testing, getting really deep in the weeds.
- Do high win ratios increase your MMR? Or is it just you're just playing in hard mode. Did we lose Aaron Goose? Yeah, Goose left a while ago. Thanks for having us.
- Players' skill rating does fluctuate and can go up and down depending on the results of your game. A lot of this is provably fair verifiably random using on chain randomizers. People get salty in these kind of, I guess, ranked ecosystems.
- Noxious tends to be more of a ranged character. His special trait is an acid launcher that applies damage to multiple characters. When you draft the new brawler, do they start back at Level One?
- Chuba. Welcome to the stream. So we lost head of gaming. We're going to add Head of Engineering to we were just chatting about some of your rankings questions. You can answer those in better detail.
- We have these different ranking systems. The highest bucket is a Titan three. We've been tuning the difficulty with a handful of different parameters. We'll continue tuning that and kind of try to have a difficult game that is as fun as possible.
- It's a combination of how well you play as well as how much you play. Playing on higher difficulty will earn you more battle points. How do you prevent people from just setting up a bot to play all day nonstop?
- I'd say probably across ten to 15 countries all across the US. US we've never had a single physical brick and mortar office either. Have you had any offline out of the any team building meetups?
- We're over 60 now. It's like a not insignificantly, not small sized game studio inside of a company. I've got to turn this into a profitable business again. Hopefully we can get a little bit of macro help as I watch E continue to decline.
- Did you guys participate at all in the SDIP? We had not yet applied. Nova's got that budding kind of gaming ecosystem going. You're going to see a lot I feel like Nova is really going to gravitate to more on chain focused games.
- Arbitram Nova is a new Brawler game that uses the blockchain. Will experience with other games like auto chess or team flight tactics play a role? We want to build this up, make it a destination for people to go to and really show the possibilities of on chain gaming.
