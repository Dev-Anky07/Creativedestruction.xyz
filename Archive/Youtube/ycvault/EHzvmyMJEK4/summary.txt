- General Consul Kirsty and Carolyn will talk about finance and legal mechanics for startups. It's very dangerous for founders to get bogged down in the details. This is certainly not the most exciting of the classes, sorry. But if you get this right, this is probably the classic.
- Our goal here today is to make sure that you do know better than to form your startup as a Florida LLC. There's a few other things that you need to talk about whilst you're setting up your company. If you know the basics, you can get yourself set up in the right way.
- The primary purpose for forming a separate legal entity is to protect yourselves from personal liability. Delaware is in the business of forming corporations. Investors are very comfortable with Delaware. Keep it simple and familiar for yourself.
- So once you've decided that you're going to be a Delaware corporation, how do you actually set that up? It requires a few different steps, but the first one is actually really easy. Keep these signed documents in a safe place.
- A lot of founder teams give way too much credit to the person who came up with the idea for the company. Y Combinator's mantra is that stock allocation doesn't have to be exactly equal. When ownership is disproportionate, what we worry about is that the founders are not in sync with one another.
- Vesting means that you get full ownership of your stock over a specific period of time. The reason is because the skin in the game concept applies to solo founders as well. Investors really want to see all founders incentivized to stay at the company for a long time.
- There are two ways to raise money. Either the price is set for the money that comes in, or the price isn't set. Usually the way that this is done is through convertible notes or safes. Investors should be sophisticated and understand that investing in startups is risky.
- Some investors will ask for a seat on your company's board of directors. You have to be really careful about adding an investor to your board. Having money is very valuable, but someone who really helps with strategy and direction is priceless.
- Next we're going to talk about pro rada rights. It's the right to maintain your percentage ownership in a company. Peretta rights are a way to avoid dilution. Investors almost always want contractual information rights to get certain information about your company.
- Business expenses are the cost of carrying out your business. Business expenses are important because they get deducted on the company's tax. If it's a non business expense that the company incurs, then that is not deductible on the tax return. Do not go to Vegas on investors'money and spend that money wisely.
- The first topic is founder employment. Working for free is against the law and founders should not let their company take on this liability. Companies have to pay payroll taxes. Don't go overboard on lavish salaries, minimum wage. This is still a startup and you have to run lean.
- Unpaid wages become leverage for the fired founder to get something he or she wants from the company. Avoid problems by paying yourself, paying your payroll taxes, and thinking of your co founders wages like a marital prenup. And as well as the founders, you are going to need to hire employees.
- Firing people is really hard. Here are some best practices for how to fire someone. Don't let a bad employee linger. Pay all wages and accrue to vacation immediately. If terminated employee has invested shares, repurchase them right away.
- Keep it simple, do all the standard stuff, and keep it organized. Equity ownership is really important. If an employee must be fired, then, as Carolyn was saying, do it quickly and professionally. A lot of running a company is following the rules and taking it seriously.
- You do need to get a CPA at some point because you need to file your annual tax returns for the company. How do you find one? Probably the best thing is recommendations from people with any kind of specialist. When you actually need to hire a lawyer, it depends on what business you are starting.
- Do you guys have any advice or comment on the complexity that comes with working with cryptocurrencies or crypto equities in particular? Often banks will struggle to deal with companies that are working in cryptocurrencies. It's not something that kind of has real general advice, unfortunately.
