- As part of the Summer protocols, I led one of the ten core research projects alongside another 33 researchers. The research focused on the role of protocols shaping society and will be published in March of next year. I encourage all of you to sign up with your email.
- Almost 20 years later, at daybreak it was actually 06:15 A.m., another hurricane hit. This time, infamous, the hurricane was a magnitude more dangerous. No one really could have imagined the damage that Maria would really bestow upon Puerto Rico.
- Digital diaspora mobilized into a swarm to help Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria. The collective anxiety had actually transformed into a message of support. While governmental agencies and aid organizations had to seek approvals, we were able to permissionlessly, act freely.
- Swarms behave differently than what we've mentioned in terms of animal aggregation, crowds and gorillas. They navigate digital terrain, not physical ones. The promise is a central connection between all the members in a guerrilla community.
- Swarms, like hurricanes, are gargantuan tempests, but they do have predictable life cycles. Like hurricanes, swarms can only grow as long as the ecosystem supports their presence. Compounding growth is not sustainable, and eventually you do dissipate.
- Swarms can vary widely, though, in the amount of styles and emotions that they evoke. The collective behavior of participants can create distinct experiences. To best understand swarms, we need to understand the other types of collectives that exist here.
- Central moderation is giving way to crowdsourced. An attunement instead is about shaping the network structure and orientation to best achieve the goals of the network that's participating. It is a caregiving approach, and maybe we can find patterns of design where collectives can live in harmony.
- In high bandwidth networks, alongside autonomous bots and content, swarms have inherited and amplified the power and responsibilities of crowds. Swarms, like crowds, do not have to be destructive. They can be symbiotic allies, not just resources or adversaries. I'm going to open it for questions and comments from everyone in the audience.
- A key challenge for network participants in these swarms is the ability to handle complexity. It's very difficult to get swarm momentum if you don't actually have clarity in terms of that promise. crafting a compelling promise from a central perspective can actually be quite difficult.
- Are there platonic forms of sort of organization that you're finding among different types of kind of groups other than humans? This opens the door to a lot of questions around when we start thinking about digital footprint of humans within enmeshed with content and bots. It also gets you to this concept of digital warfare.
- Swarms are based on stigmaji, when the parts of the swarms send signals to each other. How good is it in terms of long term decision making? Could swarms lead to a very different type of innovation that we can't imagine.
- The easiest way to kill a swarm is to prevent people from communicating with each other. At the end of the day, swarms are dependent on the ecosystem that they live in. The fastest way to killing the swarm is change the ecosystem rules.
