- Everybody. Thumbs up if you can hear me, please. Just testing my audio here.
- Mel, I added you as co host here, and I also sent a request into Kift. Dow Denver, if you're there, Flo or Steve or whoever that happens to be, because Elon seems to be tinkering and messing around with the Twitter code. If everyone wants to share the space, by the way, just do a little tweet and ask people to join.
- "I just like the road. It just clears the mind. It's good for thinking, " he says. He plans to do the drive out in three days and the drive back in two. The longest drive he ever did was probably on the motorcycle.
- A Telegram group to continue some of the thought leader discussions. Punkar and I are part of the Dao Governance Telegram group. Feel free to join or share. If there's other things you want to talk about, not specifically governance related.
- This is a Twitter space about decentralization as it pertains to DAOs and other online communities. Follow the speakers when they jump up. If you're looking to volunteer as a contributor, writer or moderator, just send me a DM.
- There's several speakers here today. Just introduce yourselves as a speaker. If someone rambles on a bit too long or gets off topic, then I'll just smash that mute button. Let's try and keep things around dows and decentralization. Last rule is to just have some fun.
- Is decentralized a binary topic, or is it a sliding scale from zero to 100 and why? Colin, I think you had your hand up. You can feel free to chime in.
- In the Dao ecosystem, we call ourselves Dows. It's kind of OD to be introducing a trust element into what's supposed to be a trustless world. These are all areas of centralization that often gets overlooked.
- Punkar: I love DAOs because I think it's the best coordination mechanism we have so far. On decentralization, I don't believe in that kind of binary definition like it's decentralized or it's not decentralized. To determine if the decentralization is sufficient, the community itself needs to determine that.
- Next up was either Mel or Shlomo and then Dow, planets and Meg in that order. Mel is interested in Good Governance Philosophy, and really that Comes Down To Dows. Thanks for being a sounding board for all of this crazy stuff, everyone and coming to hear us speak.
- But I think decentralization for me, it comes down to a couple of questions that have to get answered before I can say why do we do it? And I think really you have to talk a bit about boundaries, right, before you can talk too much about decentralization.
- Decentralization is knowledge, right? You only get siloed when you don't know how to enact changes in your own life. It's not a binary thing of decentralized or not, it's about empowering the mission. There certainly are extremes and either of the extremes can perhaps be not good.
- When should an organization look at being more decentralized and how to get there? What is the optimal level of decentralization and redundancy? And again, just something to think about while we're all listening.
- How decentralized is your organization right now, and do you think it's a good or a bad thing now? Meg, you've been waiting very patiently. The speaking stages all yours.
- Meg: I'm the VP of Product and Ops at Flipside Crypto. Metrics dow is probably, I'll call it at like 33% decentralized right now. I've been working on a definition of decentralization for my ETH Denver Talk next week.
- Dow Denver is coming. Who else is going to Dow Denver? On a scale of zero to 100, how decentralized is your organization right now? What are the most effective paths to becoming more decentralized?
-  decentralization is both a value and an intention. It is an intention of the organization of the Dow to get more decentralized over time. An easy way to get there is if you're voting today. Just implement quadratic voting.
- Sean, I wondered if you would sort of engage with me a little bit in a discussion around the quadratic voting system and reputation based waiting. Are you down for a little chat and like, little discussion, maybe debate?
- When many people come together and collaborate from diverse perspectives, we can create better things. At Kift, we're thinking about creating a leadership council and working on decentralization. Should we implement reputation systems? Kind of what are the steps to decentralized?
- Speaking of podcasts, I'm going to do a couple little cues here. I see Ryan reef is listening in. And I'm curious from the artistic community perspective, and the integration of artists and building their communities now that enabled with blockchain technology. Mel, you are up next here.
- This is incredible. The perspectives here really just have me thinking about these things in a lot of new ways. metrics are really important in this space. Whatever can be measured can be a point of differentiation. I still come back to, though, why decentralize?
- We are losing most of this focus on creating systems of elections. What are Dao supposed to do? They're supposed to deliver something, create some value. When a community is focused so hard on the rules, we can lose sight of what we're trying to accomplish.
- To what degree is your community focused on building versus controlling the processes? How do we increase participation in the Dao ecosystem? Is perhaps participation more important than governance?
- Joseph: I think it could be the biggest revolution in our times. DAOs and applying it to governance of communities. There's a real demand for alternative self governance and decentralization. I just hope people might build something like this that is useful for everyone.
- Ryan, you're up next here because I haven't heard you speak yet. I think on the whole issue of like the decentralization question, it gets sort of stuck in a sense because it's only centralized or decentralized. Something that I think we need to focus on more is non economic incentives.
- Amir Bursa: I'm a part of Krause, but I haven't really been following much. I'm curious if you have any thoughts here on the Krause house side about decentralization, about participation. Are you going to Denver, by the way?
- Pankar: We should focus more on quality of participation than quantity. When you are maybe changing the dow or going through some transition, you need to have some person to rely on. How do we incentivize the higher quality participation?
- The best way to generate participation is to have some type of shared vision. Establishing that vision amongst the community is such a key step in helping everything flow smoothly. As your Dao grows and evolves, don't be afraid to adapt or evolve that vision.
- Amir: I would love to co host a space with Arvin at Sold Out Secrets on decentralization. It would pit the bitcoin Maxis versus the Ethereum community on which know more decentralized. Amir: Can someone come in and actually talk in an intelligent way?
- Am I an example of a bad community member in Krause house? And why or not? Dao, like Utrecht said, needs a policy to help its members engage throughout the mission. And the problem is that the core team failed to include all of the members in decision making.
- Up next is Uthred and Coin. Brego is a Twitter space beatbox performer. I wanted to invite you at the end of this space, if you wanted to take 30 40 seconds to give us a sample. It's really cool to see the diversity of people here now.
- Why would I care about something if I do not have the rights? No franchise, right? No rights, no representations. And that is the problem with token weighted voting. The more people do it, the bigger it grows without that legitimacy.
- What if there was a minimum participation requirement on everyone's NFT in the Dao? If you don't participate, there's a signature auto filled in the smart contract that forces that NFT back into the open market. Communities are more focused on participation and getting active builders.
- But yeah, I'm interested in obviously the topic of decentralization. Can I have a second? Hold on a second. Mel, I think you were next with your hand up if you want to pick up. We'll bring back Coin as soon as he's freed up.
- The way I perceive decentralization is the ability to take control from kind of the many to the few and back again. Would you mind if I read a quote from a book that I thought of when you were talking about that? I'm very open to engagement and feedback on these topics.
- Mel, I'm always curious. Are you going to be there? I will be, hopefully. Me and Boss Dragon will be there and we're doing a big hack on governance topics. I'd actually love to get together with you guys, know, host something and continue the chats there.
- One of my passions is this idea of figuring out how to get the concept of liquid democracy out to IRL voting. The problem space is the same as it's always been, but the solution space is absolutely exponential. Right now is an amazing time to be in this space.
- One thing I was curious about if you guys had knowledge or experience in is the Colony Protocol. They have like a meritocracy style reputation system. Should a governance NFT or governance token be rewarded with extra weight by fill in the blank standard of participation?
- Adele: I think communicating is the first and utmost important thing in engaging Dao members. Once these are not discussed, it's really difficult to discuss them in the middle of governing. The governing members of the Dao needs to have a clear communication, routine strategy and way to approach the members.
- Amir: There's a distinction between punishment and consequences. He says it's almost refreshing when people actually see the consequence of their own actions. There should be both sides of consequences and consequences, he says.
- What does participation mean in a Dow in this context? And how can we actually track it? Because you can track voting, proposal pushing, and town hall participating like attendance. Is that enough stuff to track? Or do you disagree that one of those things maybe shouldn't be tracked?
- The panelists discuss how to reward good governance in the digital world. If people are governing well, we reward them and we have the benefit of time which can tell us if that's true or not. I put a link to a brand new Telegram group I called Dao Thought Leaders.
- Uthred: Rights versus responsibilities. You get rights because you have responsibilities. There is not one without the other. Amir: Governance is best centralized if the community is larger. I'd love to speak with you offline if you wanted to join the Telegram group too.
- In these Dows, except for the contributors, people are there because they like the idea. If you say, okay, I'm going to punish you, I think Dao would end up losing the majority. On the flip side, make sure you take steps forward. Keep everyone motivated as much as you can.
- Amir: I look forward to seeing you at East Denver and specifically at Dow Denver. Join the telegram group. Sign up for the substac. Let's decide together what we think the hot next space topic might be. Beatbox time.
