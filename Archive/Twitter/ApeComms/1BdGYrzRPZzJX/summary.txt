- Apecoms special Counsel debrief number 47. Consider this the library session. A couple of technical difficulties. Feel free to come on, raise your hand, I'll get you up. No music this fine, fine Wednesday morning.
- Got some questions for the special counsel. This is the one day in the week that the special. counsel comes on up and we do a special council debrief and we ask them. questions. If you as part of the community have questions, please raise your hand and ask your question.
- The Hodla Collective is an informal group of members of the Apecoin community. Everything they discuss is their personal opinion and not representative of the foundation. Wednesdays we try and keep it on point, on track for special counsel.
- Apecoms presents apecoin Special Council Debrief Number 47. Every Wednesday for the last 47 weeks, they have been here answering the questions of the community. If you got any questions, come on up.
- Aaron: Apecoin chili chain. I just like the way it sounds. It's for Vera, right? Panel recognizes Aaron as waiting for the special counsel to receive their notes.
- The Board Chili collaboration with Apecoin Dow for a podcast. It was done yesterday. Woban, Jerry and Cap on the podcast. Probably takes me another five to 8 hours to do, but I think we're expecting it to be live this Saturday.
- Barry: Can you let us know about what you've been working on with the IP and with the trademark? We have a process like the form that everyone can submit. Some a little bit update may be going to happen, but it's not really finalized yet.
- If Jerry was there, there was a couple of cats at least, right? But will you give us maybe you said Cap captain Trippy? I said a trippy, not cat. So cap cats.
- First series of Board Chili podcast is called 100 Hot Ones. The purpose is to interview 100 ape owners BYC MOIC owners to share who they are. Next few days is getting all the podcasts live so that we can give the candidates or the nominees some information.
- Can anybody put powered by Apecoin on their stuff? And at this point, yes. podcasts are not easy. It takes at least like 10 hours from planning, recording, editing. Even hosting Twitter space is a lot of time.
- I'm here to talk about Chili chain. Like I've always said, I think we need multiple ape chains. I think I'm going to talk to the Governance Working Group again. There's room for improvement.
- I love your podcast, Vera. I almost gave up on creating it because it was just like very time consuming. Someone ran into me in Hong Kong and told me why don't you update your podcast. I'll continue to do it. Love it, love it.
- Aaron: We're trying to allow the community that we have this trademark process. What if a big brand wants to come and use the Apoin IP? How do you work with them? We're definitely not at that point where everything's ironed out. But we are trying to make it as easy as possible.
- SC has been preparing for elections. Says she's coordinating with discourse facilitators, governance working group and administrators. Has taken a lot of calls with candidates who want to know more about the role.
- SC member: The elections are anybody's game. Clear your schedule and have some fun and enjoy the process. You have to have a message and a vision for the Dow and for what you want to accomplish.
- All right. Can we say it here or should they just wait for the podcast? I don't think you will not listen to podcasts, even though that he said it here. There's a lot of more stuff talked about.
- Whether you win or lose, you're going to gain an incredible experience. People that you're running against are going to continue to be your colleagues and people that you continue to work with even after the fact. Don't burn your bridges before they're even built.
- "No matter what happens out of the election, it's just good for you. It's into your benefit that you network and you get to know everybody around this process " "You have to have a plan or you're really planning to fail "
- I do hear a lot of conversations regarding voting. A lot of candidates are interested in knowing how my experience is, like my running tips. So that's why we created that podcast, so that we can answer the basic questions that candidates may have. We're trying to stand in very neutral position here.
- Pete: My questions are too spicy. Why aren't you running again? Vera: You will probably hear something to answer this question in the podcast. You will hear not just from me, you'll hear something from Jerry as Jerry.
- There was an apefest debrief that you mentioned, and then there was also a little wink, a little nod to apecoin Art Basel in the notes. What's the alpha and what was the debrief like?
- GM: This week has just been a lot of work. Everybody's popping up. We love to see who's here now, who's going to be around for the next election season. We want to set yourself up for success.
- Jerry: One of the things that you had in the breakdown was advocating for a more simple language in AIPS to guide revenue back to the Dow. What does that mean? Do you have any clarifications on that? Jerry: Looking forward to seeing that come around.
- Finalizing strategies to significantly reduce the custodial fees contributing to financial efficiency. The SC was working on making sure that we're set up for the future. And it ended up being a pretty substantial amount that we were able to save everybody.
- If you have an idea for an AIP, just put it up. One sentence. Doesn't even have to be a full thought. It's important to just feel like comfortable putting up an idea so that people start talking. That's how we grow.
- Jerry: I'm also going to get a conversation going again on shielded voting front to back. I don't want anybody knowing who the hell I'm voting for in the next election. People should be able to vote with their hearts and how they feel like they should vote.
- The third point is the fun one, though. It's a big one. But I can't tell you just yet. What a dark blue ape? Just you blue, right?
- Jerry: Go to the people first. Get as many people excited about your platform as possible. If you hear critics saying this is just a popularity contest, ask those people to change the world. Ignore the negativity. Focus on the positives.
- I'm ready now to address the hands. Just every week, there's always an hour's worth at least of content in these notes. Aaron, you trolled me. But the information was fantastic and I'm glad that you asked the questions.
- When do AIP authors generally get the initial agreement and at what point does the board step in? If there's a disagreement, what happens? What is the process for the board stepping in?
- AIP 282 spelled out all the current responsibilities of the board. What are your thoughts on where the special counsel should be in terms of should it go back to the original intent of the founders of the Dao or the legal framework or are you okay with where it is now?
- Garrett: What do you drink? Meme Brains. What do I drink? Right now I'm into the ice late with honey. Man, I've got to get to the same meeting. Did you guys have any other last minute questions?
- When I hire executives and create their job descriptions, there's two parts to it. There's the broad description, which is essentially AIP two eight two. And then there's the more succinct KPIs, the measurables. It's important to make sure there's clarity going into 2024 on where that priority should be put.
- As an employee, you truly want to have your finger on the pulse of everybody in your organization. With an executive team, sometimes that's a little bit more nuanced with the positions, especially with a startup. There are quite a few things that you do on a regular basis that aren't quantifiable.
- A lot of people fail to realize when they talk about this disparagement in this income inequality. The jobs that this person took and all of the jobs that that person did that weren't in the description of CEO. They were just necessary. And they were enormous.
- And I think I had seven meetings today since 06:00 this morning. And this goes to the point that we need more organization, in my opinion. And we're trying to put together and it will probably happen under the next SC this next six months.
- Apecoin election is a popularity contest. Should I emphasize on my professional skills and certifications, or shall I go vibe style? Play to your strengths, whatever your strengths are. Community will decide whose strengths outweigh somebody else's strengths.
- SSP is running with a single issue. Authenticity and being a. Good person is what stands out. Next six months or a year for Se is crucial. Do we need to make that requirement absolutely clear to the candidates?
- The Special Counsel should be in place as a group of representatives of the community that can keep these other people in check. There really aren't a lot of people that are experts in starting and running a Dow from the ground up. The best people surround themselves with the best people in their jobs.
- G, Raymond. What's up, man? What are you thinking? Hey, what's up? Loss. Appreciate It. I won't take too long.
- Jerry: I think the Dow has a growth problem, right? Do you think voting in someone who's not part of the BYC community can actually bring more growth into the dow? I really appreciate everybody's comments. Feel free to jump in my DMs if you have any questions.
- "There a lot of game devs and stuff that are starting to monetize their stuff. I really want to put Ape chain to that. I think there's a lot that can be done there " Thanks for the nod about people that don't come from BYC.
- Lost. "I'm considering dropping out because I'm not sure if I'm up to it" How much of that is going to get pushed back. Lawyers like to make up rules as they go sometimes. It's our job to push back and make things better.
- Jerry: We need multiple ape chains. My take is that we need to fund actual public goods. This is the future, Jerry app based chains. Every community is going to have their own chain. I prioritize the community over my duties as special counsel.
- You don't have to be elected for any kind of secretary or metaverse or council position to participate in our Dao. There's over 94 proposals that are in progress from the idea stage to the implementation stage. This week looks to allow proposals to go up during the Special Council election period. You guys have less than 4 hours to get your votes in for this week.
- SSP anything before we take off? Yeah, if I could, just one last thing. Because obviously, he's just basically making the argument for SSP single issue. It's community based, that's the main thing. So, yeah, I appreciated Jerry's input today.
- For today adventure. Save anything you want to say before we wrap it up. Let everybody have the opportunity to have the discussion again monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and noon. If you guys have questions, you DM me, you can DM SSP. See you guys on Friday.
