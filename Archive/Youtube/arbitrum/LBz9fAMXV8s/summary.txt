- Today we are speaking with Bracket Labs essentially actually a project that went live a little over a week ago. And we're just going to be talking all about their project today. Really appreciate the audience.
- Mike: Background wise, on my side, mostly actually in kind of traditional fintech. Originally worked for Bloomberg, doing some cool stuff with their forensic trade reconstruction message compliance teams with bulge bracket banks. Found Ethereum and was really engaged with the smart contract concept. Since then it's been kind of one, one and a half years now working on this project.
- Bracket Protocol is a D Five primitive that could simplify traditional options and structured products to better suit the Web Three landscape. The company's first product, Bracket X, is demonstrating how it can be applied right.
- The Protocol is focused on reimagining that formula options formula, so that it can be used in web like options. And pricing. In terms of the pricing, why don't I get to that later?
- It's been a little over a week since our launch. Right now we have 9761 total transactions. Each of the contracts on the buyer side is associated with an NFT ID. We have very low volatility, but we consider that a really successful launch.
- The market is not great, right? It's really flat. How has that affected your launch, if at all, in any way? In a low vol environment, it's a little bit less exciting. But as Vault picks up, there's going to be a lot more excitement around Bracketx.
- Jason: We really like the off chain Labs team, right? So they were extremely helpful in helping us talk to other teams. Of course, we also cared a lot about cost and speed, given sort of how the protocol was designed. And then I think finally, there is a very robust DeFi and training community.
- There are a ton of different types of leveraged perpetual products that live on Arbitrum already. What we also value is making sure that whatever we're building internally that everything is as secure as can be. What have you guys kind of done on that front in terms of audits and security?
- Security is absolutely critical. It couldn't be more important. Trust is paramount on blockchain. Without it, you have nothing. And I truly think that dedication to making sure the system is secure really does go a long way.
- Making something that was pure on chain hasn't been done by other people for derivatives. The way that options work traditionally requires constant repricing because you're constantly moving. Also had to create a way of doing order management. Those two things were really the key to getting derivatives option strategies to be on chain.
- In terms of the innovations we built into bracket, there's a few things. What we're doing is bull call spreads and bare put spreads. We packaged it into one product that has both legs essentially in the product. One of the other things we want to solve is to have the fixed payoffs.
- Bracket X is a way to take advantage of low volatility and make money that way. What's coming after that is an integrated version of the product where it acts a little bit more like insurance on downside protection. We should have it out by end of year for sure.
- Going into 2023, this does sort of paint a bright sort of future for DFI. A lot of people have moved off exchanges, they've gone into self custody. People will be building no matter what. Most large brands are starting to tinker in the space.
- Join Bracketx Phi. Just go on the URL, and it'll have all the links there for you. Follow us on our socials for keeping up with news. Also make sure by the way, for those who maybe got in a little bit later to post the actual link to their announcement.
- Yeah. Thanks for giving us the time. It's been great and we look forward to seeing you flourish on Arbitrage. Have a good one, y'all.
