- Explosion of traditional orgs. driving us toward a new Cambrian explosion of a different kind of organization decentralized, autonomous organizations. Dows are a way to transcend traditional bureaucracy, to get stuff done, to create value. Are there challenges with organizing and managing and maintaining Dows?
- Don't use force and keep commitments. The closer we get to that ideal state, the better off we are as human beings. Keeping commitments has quantifiable financial and economic value. Buy in between self managed individuals working together around a common mission.
- Did you notice any interesting power dynamics in this new way of working? People tend to connect with seven to twelve fellow colleagues. The culture, I would say, is self healing and self correcting.
- Morningstar's self management agreements start with a personal commercial mission. To what degree do those services represent management? "Self management means everyone is a manager to the degree they're interested and capable"
- The business itself or the Dow itself, really determines and defines what decisions have to be made. Long term strategic decisions that can make or break an organization. How do you make those decisions and what are they? That's really crucial to figure out. And it's a huge untapped opportunity.
- The contract works so well because it's not just a technical services agreement, it's also a social contract. All these aspects of social interaction are also crucial to success in an ecosystem. How do groups of people naturally work together to create a product for sale?
- Each geographic location forms a compensation committee composed of representatives from all aspects of the organization. It's about agency on the part of individuals, autonomy, freedom. Sometimes the committee accepts the business case outright. Sometimes they negotiate a lower increase.

- The self management canvas is really about how we work together. The business model canvas has to do a lot with customers and markets. This really doesn't address that at all. It's about who we work with and how we allocate roles and responsibilities.
- Paolo: Where would you start with trying to become explicit about who can make decisions? Paolo: There are so many ways to make decisions and if people don't agree on those ways, that's a big source of conflict. Would you have any suggestions for extracting and documenting those?
- Paula, do you have tips for us to unlearn top down management and start to be open to self management? Because ultimately, it's really philosophy at the heart of this. We're trying to create a better world.
- Next week, Graham Spencer will talk about anti captures and anti capture. Doug, I don't know if you would accept to perhaps join in our discord. At the bottom of this document, you can find a link to join the discord. And there in our Learning and Discussion Channel, we can continue the conversation.
- We have another workshop starting and our time is up. This has been fantastic. And have a lovely rest of the day, you all. Thanks, Daniel.
