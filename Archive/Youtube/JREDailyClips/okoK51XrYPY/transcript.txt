[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker A : You know, like, I've even had people tell me they've eaten the thing that I'm looking for.
[ 0:00:03.000 ---> 0:00:04.000 ] Speaker B : Really?
[ 0:00:04.000 ---> 0:00:21.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. When we were doing extinct, you know, looking for the extinct animals of which we had success quite a lot. But I've had guys be like, oh, yeah, yeah, they're delicious. I'm like, what? Like, tell me where to find it. Like, you've eaten it and you have no reason to lie about this whatsoever. Like, please just help me.
[ 0:00:21.000 ---> 0:00:22.000 ] Speaker B : What was this that they did that.
[ 0:00:22.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker A : Was regarding that Cayman? Remember that yellow Cayman? And we did find them, so that worked out. But literally, I remember we're walking through the village in day one, before we even get in the canoes, and I'm, like, showing people these pictures of all the different species of Cayman. And I kept pointing to the Trumpa Largo Amarillo, the long nose yellow one. Right? And everybody's like, yes. No, maybe one time. And then one guy's like, whoa, those are delicious. And I'm like, oh, God, can we put this on Animal Planet? I don't even know. Can you say that, that this thing.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker B : Is endangered species you're eating? Well, there was always these rumors of these places where these billionaires would fly into in China and eat like, yeah. Have you ever heard of that?
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:17.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I've heard about it. I believe it too. I really do. Yeah. I think that especially with China, where the Eastern medicine and the status symbol of eating tiger whiskers and this, that and the other thing, there's a status.
[ 0:01:17.000 ---> 0:01:21.000 ] Speaker B : Symbol of eating something that's forbidden and very difficult to.
[ 0:01:22.000 ---> 0:01:37.000 ] Speaker A : And, you know, China has so many billionaires now, I forget what it is. But dozens and dozens of. Right. Like, if that status symbol is important to someone with that much power and money, how are you not getting it? Yeah.
[ 0:01:37.000 ---> 0:01:43.000 ] Speaker B : What a weird culture where your status is based on eating something that's endangered.
[ 0:01:43.000 ---> 0:01:51.000 ] Speaker A : It doesn't even click in my head. Like, I cannot physically understand it. No. Part of me is like, oh, I get that. I really want to eat some tiger whiskers.
[ 0:01:51.000 ---> 0:01:53.000 ] Speaker B : Have we ever talked about the Bondo ape?
[ 0:01:53.000 ---> 0:01:59.000 ] Speaker A : Yes, you have? Yeah. I know you like the Bondo Ape a lot. Yeah. Big lion killing apes.
[ 0:01:59.000 ---> 0:02:10.000 ] Speaker B : Well, this is a big chimpanzee that lives in the Congo, which is. The Congo is so incredible. It's like, God, what an insanely rich, resource ridden place that's also a war.
[ 0:02:10.000 ---> 0:02:19.000 ] Speaker A : Zone and being absolutely raped and pillaged. Know big corporations in the Western world for resources and Minerals.
[ 0:02:19.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker B : I had said Darth Kara on who? His book, I think his book comes out. Does it come out next week? It comes out the end of January. Okay. But his book is all about cobalt mining.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:34.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, interesting.
[ 0:02:34.000 ---> 0:02:35.000 ] Speaker B : And it's horrible.
[ 0:02:35.000 ---> 0:02:37.000 ] Speaker A : I do want to read it. Yeah.
[ 0:02:37.000 ---> 0:02:58.000 ] Speaker B : Horrifying. 19 year old girls with babies on their back were hand chipping cobalt out of the ground and then inhaling all these toxic fumes and powder, this dust. And then that is in your cell phone. That's how the cobalt gets into your fucking cell phone.
[ 0:02:58.000 ---> 0:03:34.000 ] Speaker A : That's at your Apple store. It's the new blood diamond. Right. And it's funny because I feel like the whole blood diamond thing and there's been lots of these things, but it all sort of went away because it got exposed. But I feel like no one's talking about the inhumane things that are taking place for our modern conveniences. It's one thing when it's a luxury like a blood diamond. Right. Or whatever, but when it's like, oh, well, I can't live without my iPhone, then it's like we're willing to turn a blind eye to it. It's like people choose not to accept it because it's part of their life.
[ 0:03:34.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker B : Let's just think about how many people who consider themselves social justice warriors and they do this complaining on a phone that's made by slaves.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker A : Totally.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:43.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:50.000 ] Speaker A : They're literally tweeting or texting or whatever their complaints on a thing that is contributing to the thing they're complaining about.
[ 0:03:50.000 ---> 0:03:55.000 ] Speaker B : Well, the contributing to the worst version of it in humanity right now.
[ 0:03:55.000 ---> 0:03:56.000 ] Speaker A : Isn't it really crazy?
[ 0:03:56.000 ---> 0:03:58.000 ] Speaker B : It's like, literally human trafficking.
[ 0:03:58.000 ---> 0:04:02.000 ] Speaker A : So, in the book, does he actually go into the Congo and witness this?
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, yeah.
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:04.000 ] Speaker A : He took video footage.
[ 0:04:05.000 ---> 0:04:43.000 ] Speaker B : His story is so compelling, and he talks about it with such passion because he worked on this for years and years and risked his life to obtain footage and to get access and to go to these, what they're supposedly ethical minds. And he's like, this is all horrible. All of it is tainted. All the cobalt that we have. All of it is at least in some part, coming from these. What they would call. It's basically just the most primitive version. People in flip flops with hammers chipping it out of the ground.
[ 0:04:43.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker A : What's extreme poverty?
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker B : Yes.
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:04:46.000 ] Speaker A : Right.
[ 0:04:46.000 ---> 0:04:47.000 ] Speaker B : It's more like slavery.
[ 0:04:47.000 ---> 0:04:48.000 ] Speaker A : It is.
[ 0:04:48.000 ---> 0:04:55.000 ] Speaker B : Calling it extreme poverty, I think, is not quite accurate enough. They call them artisanal minds, which is.
[ 0:04:55.000 ---> 0:05:00.000 ] Speaker A : Like, hilarious, because anytime you slap that word onto anything, it's fun.
[ 0:05:00.000 ---> 0:05:04.000 ] Speaker B : It's artisanal. Yeah. Great. I think someone's making pottery somewhere.
[ 0:05:04.000 ---> 0:05:06.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, totally. Totally.
[ 0:05:06.000 ---> 0:05:30.000 ] Speaker B : So back to the Bondo ape, because I know there was some controversy behind that, and there's some people that sort of denied its existence. But then Carl Armand got photographs of them and they obtained skulls that were a chimpanzee skull that had a crest, but they also had a crest like the same way that a gorilla does.
[ 0:05:30.000 ---> 0:06:02.000 ] Speaker A : My understanding, and this is not something I'm super familiar with, but there's no denying that they existed. Right? There was this insular gigantism that took place within this group of chimpanzees. There was heightened aggression, that's all known and documented, but it wasn't a new species, it wasn't a distinct species. It was sexual, or rather natural selection that led to these animals being different and isolated and turning into larger, more aggressive chimpanzees. That's my understanding of it.
[ 0:06:02.000 ---> 0:06:07.000 ] Speaker B : But would that also make their skulls different?
[ 0:06:07.000 ---> 0:06:10.000 ] Speaker A : It can do, because, like, okay, well.
[ 0:06:10.000 ---> 0:06:11.000 ] Speaker B : Odly enough, we have a skull.
[ 0:06:12.000 ---> 0:06:12.000 ] Speaker A : Very cool.
[ 0:06:13.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker B : This is made by Shane against the machine, who's a guy on Instagram who's an incredible artist.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, cool.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker B : Made a couple of pieces for the podcast.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:21.000 ] Speaker A : All right.
[ 0:06:21.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker B : The difference is with this skull versus what they think the Bondo ape skull is that the Bondo ape has like a bone mohawk Right through. Yeah, like a gorilla.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:07:21.000 ] Speaker A : So, you know, sexual selection over time can evolve for anything, can adapt for anything, right? That's why peacocks have the silly tail they have. It doesn't help them fly. Right? It's only sexual selection it's being bred for. So you get a bunch of chimps stuck on an island, stuck in a region, and the females decide, for whatever reason, that a bump on the head is sexy. Okay? Now every chimp that has a slight bump on its head is being selected for by the females to reproduce offspring. Fast forward 1520 generations, maybe 200 generations, whatever. They all have a crest on their head. That is how evolution begins. Because now you fast forward millions of years and the sexual selection has been selected for over and over and over and over, and you're starting to turn into a new creature, a new organism altogether.
[ 0:07:23.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker B : I don't think I'm incorrect here. I think the crest indicates enormous mandible muscles.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:32.000 ] Speaker A : Because the muscles attach up there.
[ 0:07:32.000 ---> 0:07:36.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I think that's what the crest is for, because that's how it is with dogs.
[ 0:07:36.000 ---> 0:07:37.000 ] Speaker A : Sure.
[ 0:07:37.000 ---> 0:07:41.000 ] Speaker B : Have you ever noticed the difference between a dog that's castrated and a dog that's not fixed?
[ 0:07:41.000 ---> 0:07:42.000 ] Speaker A : Temperament? Sure.
[ 0:07:42.000 ---> 0:07:43.000 ] Speaker B : The size of their heads.
[ 0:07:43.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, interesting.
[ 0:07:44.000 ---> 0:07:54.000 ] Speaker B : My dog is a golden retriever, sweetest dog in the world. He has pretty big head, and the muscles in his head are big on the sides of his head because he has his testosterone.
