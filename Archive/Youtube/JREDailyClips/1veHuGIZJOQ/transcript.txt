[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:02.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. One giant blunder.
[ 0:00:02.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker B : It's a big blunder.
[ 0:00:03.000 ---> 0:00:07.000 ] Speaker A : It's a big one. Yeah. I got you kind of the worst.
[ 0:00:07.000 ---> 0:00:09.000 ] Speaker B : Blunder, almost the worst blunder you can make.
[ 0:00:09.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : It's the worst. It involves every bad thing. Yeah. Guns, kids, lies.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker B : But didn't he take it back before they.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:17.000 ] Speaker C : He did, but got him.
[ 0:00:17.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker A : But the problem is, you know, those people sued him and won. $965,000,000.
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker B : That's a lot of money.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : And in Connecticut, they want a large settlement in Texas, but in Texas it's capped. So I think it's capped at like 700 and something thousand dollars. So even though it might have been like 40 million, really, he has to pay $750,000 per one. So it was like 1.5 million or something. But then the Connecticut one's not capped. The Connecticut one's different. Yeah.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker B : Isn't it like a billion dollars?
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:00:50.000 ] Speaker A : It's close to a billion dollars. Yeah.
[ 0:00:50.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker B : That's a pretty funny way to end it.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:00:53.000 ] Speaker D : Is he on a payment plan?
[ 0:00:53.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker B : Who is the judge? Dr.
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:01:07.000 ] Speaker A : Evil. How can you ever come up with that number? That number is so crazy. The number only exists if you're trying to just put someone out of business, like, completely and forever. Yeah.
[ 0:01:07.000 ---> 0:01:09.000 ] Speaker D : I mean, he's still going, isn't he?
[ 0:01:09.000 ---> 0:01:10.000 ] Speaker A : Is he still going? Yeah.
[ 0:01:10.000 ---> 0:01:12.000 ] Speaker B : He's not going to be able to make a fucking billion, dude.
[ 0:01:12.000 ---> 0:01:22.000 ] Speaker A : This is impossible. But the other question is, if it goes back to trial, do they reduce? Like, how does that work?
[ 0:01:22.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker D : Are you allowed to imagine you can appeal? I mean, it's probably pretty. I don't know. Who knows?
[ 0:01:28.000 ---> 0:01:30.000 ] Speaker A : I'm just like, this could go on forever and just bleed him financially.
[ 0:01:30.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker B : He should get a pirate ship. He should go out to the seas.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:34.000 ] Speaker D : True.
[ 0:01:34.000 ---> 0:01:37.000 ] Speaker B : And broadcast from the seas. You should save up enough money to buy a boat.
[ 0:01:37.000 ---> 0:01:38.000 ] Speaker A : Should buy Epstein's Island.
[ 0:01:38.000 ---> 0:01:39.000 ] Speaker B : He should.
[ 0:01:39.000 ---> 0:01:39.000 ] Speaker A : It's for sale.
[ 0:01:39.000 ---> 0:01:40.000 ] Speaker D : What's going on with it?
[ 0:01:40.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker A : It's for sale.
[ 0:01:41.000 ---> 0:01:42.000 ] Speaker D : Nobody wants it.
[ 0:01:42.000 ---> 0:01:45.000 ] Speaker A : Do you want it? I can't say. Trying to say you want it.
[ 0:01:45.000 ---> 0:01:46.000 ] Speaker D : Open like a sandals.
[ 0:01:46.000 ---> 0:01:48.000 ] Speaker B : Open up a sandal.
[ 0:01:48.000 ---> 0:01:50.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, open up. It's a waste of a good island.
[ 0:01:50.000 ---> 0:01:56.000 ] Speaker A : Ghosts would be floating around that island. Young, hot ghost Russian.
[ 0:01:56.000 ---> 0:01:58.000 ] Speaker B : The best ghosts of all time.
[ 0:01:58.000 ---> 0:02:01.000 ] Speaker A : You'd be chasing them like, no, come back.
[ 0:02:01.000 ---> 0:02:02.000 ] Speaker D : Haunt me.
[ 0:02:02.000 ---> 0:02:06.000 ] Speaker A : They come in, I'm lonely. I'm over here watching Avatar by myself.
[ 0:02:06.000 ---> 0:02:07.000 ] Speaker D : Whoa.
[ 0:02:07.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker A : Bespoke. It's $55 million. Pro 55. Scroll back up so I can get an overhead again. Look at that.
[ 0:02:15.000 ---> 0:02:16.000 ] Speaker B : There's the temple.
[ 0:02:16.000 ---> 0:02:17.000 ] Speaker D : That's the temple.
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:02:26.000 ] Speaker A : Imagine if I open up a podcast studio where Epstein's island used to be. I mean, just imagine. So where do they fly them in? They fly them in somewhere else, and then they have to yacht it out.
[ 0:02:26.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker C : There, whatever it's called. The big St. James has a airstrip on it. And then they take a boat, actually.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:35.000 ] Speaker B : What's stopping you from doing this is.
[ 0:02:35.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker A : Like, did you see the glass onion? Did you see that, Jamie? I did not watch the Netflix. It's knives out. It's fun. It's good. But the dude is kind of like an Elon Musk character, and he owns an island just like this.
[ 0:02:49.000 ---> 0:02:52.000 ] Speaker C : Fly into St. Thomas and take a private helicopter.
[ 0:02:52.000 ---> 0:03:05.000 ] Speaker A : It's amazing. Nobody wants that island. Do you know how many recording pieces of equipment you have to tear down every wall. Every wall is bugged. Everything. There's probably every fucking picture. The eyes are filming you. Yeah. Shit.
[ 0:03:05.000 ---> 0:03:05.000 ] Speaker C : Great scene.
[ 0:03:05.000 ---> 0:03:08.000 ] Speaker D : I mean, I'd imagine you want to demolish everything anyway, so you have to.
[ 0:03:08.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker A : Land on that one little island. That's a landing strip. And then from. That's a helipad, it says, is that a landing strip too?
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:19.000 ] Speaker C : I thought this one did, but it said, you land on St. Thomas, that might be back here, and then you take.
[ 0:03:19.000 ---> 0:03:20.000 ] Speaker A : You could boat.
[ 0:03:20.000 ---> 0:03:22.000 ] Speaker B : Did they bulldoze the temple?
[ 0:03:22.000 ---> 0:03:26.000 ] Speaker A : No, that's not his island. That's not the same island. That's the island where you can land.
[ 0:03:26.000 ---> 0:03:29.000 ] Speaker C : This is the island. That's his island, yeah.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:33.000 ] Speaker A : So he has a helipad. Correct. Okay, I was confused.
[ 0:03:33.000 ---> 0:03:35.000 ] Speaker B : Picture or is that temples up?
[ 0:03:35.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker A : They were saying that this is the place where you can land. I'm like, fuck, are you going to land on this little rock?
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:03:40.000 ] Speaker D : You think someone would demolish the temple?
[ 0:03:40.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker B : You should put your podcast studio in the temple, dude.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker A : Well, why would they demolish anything? If it's valuable, somebody might want it as is. There's a lot of nutty fucking people in the world. If you're like some Saudi billionaire and you're drinking whiSkey, and you're like, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy that fucking island. Just like they bought the WWE. I'm going to buy that fucking island.
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:04.000 ] Speaker B : It's pretty fun.
[ 0:04:04.000 ---> 0:04:11.000 ] Speaker A : I'm going to stick it in Clinton's face. Look where I am. Do you recognize this room? You should.
[ 0:04:11.000 ---> 0:04:13.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I know what you're doing there.
[ 0:04:13.000 ---> 0:04:14.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:04:14.000 ---> 0:04:15.000 ] Speaker B : Trump only hung out with the staff.
[ 0:04:15.000 ---> 0:04:17.000 ] Speaker A : I only went there 26 times.
[ 0:04:17.000 ---> 0:04:18.000 ] Speaker B : 26 is a lot.
[ 0:04:18.000 ---> 0:04:19.000 ] Speaker A : 26 is not a lot of times.
[ 0:04:19.000 ---> 0:04:20.000 ] Speaker D : That's incriminating.
[ 0:04:20.000 ---> 0:04:22.000 ] Speaker A : There's so many days in the year.
[ 0:04:22.000 ---> 0:04:24.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, no one talks about that anymore.
[ 0:04:25.000 ---> 0:04:26.000 ] Speaker A : That was 26 times.
[ 0:04:26.000 ---> 0:04:27.000 ] Speaker B : You got a good Clinton.
[ 0:04:28.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker A : It's not bad. I got to listen to him. If I listen to him, I can get it pretty good.
[ 0:04:32.000 ---> 0:04:33.000 ] Speaker D : What's he up to now?
[ 0:04:33.000 ---> 0:04:37.000 ] Speaker A : Not much. Hiding? Yeah, he turned on him.
[ 0:04:37.000 ---> 0:04:38.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, but he's old.
[ 0:04:38.000 ---> 0:04:39.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, he had some rough.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:04:41.000 ] Speaker B : He's old, bro. Hill Dog.
[ 0:04:41.000 ---> 0:05:01.000 ] Speaker A : He's not just old. He's old. He had heart problems. Then he got on a vegan diet. And the vegan diet is like, you got to do that. You got to be real good with that. If you want to do that and be healthy. You have to really dot your I's and cross your T's and make sure you get all your macronutrients and shit. And you got to take supplements. He just looks like this.
[ 0:05:02.000 ---> 0:05:03.000 ] Speaker B : You're in ketosis, man.
[ 0:05:03.000 ---> 0:05:10.000 ] Speaker D : I was out of ketosis. I started getting restless leg for my whole body. I did a week. It felt awesome. I felt great.
[ 0:05:10.000 ---> 0:05:12.000 ] Speaker A : Then, like, the last leg felt great.
[ 0:05:12.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker D : No, I'm saying before that, I was like, I got out of the keto flu, and all of a sudden.
[ 0:05:15.000 ---> 0:05:17.000 ] Speaker A : Maybe there's something to restless legs. No, I hate it.
[ 0:05:17.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker D : But I had it in my arms, too. I was like a dead bug. I was in my bed, and I was just like, kind of. I think it was electrolyte thing. I looked it up. I'm going to try it again. I think I fucked up my electrolytes.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Do you take an electrolyte supplement?
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker D : No.
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker A : You should.
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:31.000 ] Speaker D : I was just so easy.
[ 0:05:32.000 ---> 0:05:35.000 ] Speaker A : Take this stuff called liquid IV. It's the shit. You dump it in water, shake it up.
[ 0:05:35.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker B : We got a lot of it.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:37.000 ] Speaker A : Tastes great.
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:05:38.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, I got to do that.
[ 0:05:38.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker A : Filled with vitamins and electrolytes. Like, so many people are deficient in certain nutrients, and so many people are dehydrated. It's so easy to be dehydrated. Like, you really should be drinking water all the fucking time.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:59.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, dude. I felt good, though. I didn't realize how different you feel. First of all, you don't need really to eat them. I was crushing carbs.
[ 0:06:00.000 ---> 0:06:00.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:06:00.000 ---> 0:06:05.000 ] Speaker D : And I went down to not eating any. I'm like, oh, I didn't know. I didn't need that. My whole life, I've been primarily eating those.
[ 0:06:05.000 ---> 0:06:34.000 ] Speaker A : I think different people react different ways. I have a budy that's been on Keto now for, like, six months. He's lost 60 pounds. He looks fucking great. He said, I'm never going back again. Dana White is another one. Dana White lost, like, 40 pounds and he's like, dude, I'm eating like this for the rest of my life. He goes, it was all just sugar and bullshit and carbs. And he was having all sorts of health problems. But my buddy looks fucking great. John Dudley, he looks great. He's, like, thin now. Like, I could hardly recognize him. He's six foot five and now he's 200 pounds.
[ 0:06:34.000 ---> 0:06:35.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, wow.
[ 0:06:35.000 ---> 0:07:00.000 ] Speaker A : That's crazy. He was like, at one point in time, he's like, 250, probably even higher. He's a big boy, and now he looks fucking lean and mean. He's like, my joints feel amazing. My energy levels are great. I just don't think it's for everybody. I don't think there's a one size fits all diet. I know a lot of people that just go vegan. They're fine. And I know a lot of people that try it and their body gets fucked up. I just think everybody's different, man.
[ 0:07:00.000 ---> 0:07:03.000 ] Speaker B : You think that happened to Bill Clinton?
[ 0:07:03.000 ---> 0:07:05.000 ] Speaker A : He looks like shit, but I think it's also.
[ 0:07:05.000 ---> 0:07:07.000 ] Speaker B : How old is he? He's. Fuck, right?
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:11.000 ] Speaker A : A lot of sleepless nights. It's a lot of thinking about all the shit he did.
[ 0:07:11.000 ---> 0:07:15.000 ] Speaker D : Imagine the Internet coming out after. You're like, towards the end, and that comes out and they're like, oh, fuck.
[ 0:07:15.000 ---> 0:07:55.000 ] Speaker A : Not just that, but having to live with being the president and all the shit that you gave the fucking thumbs up to and all the people that died and all the countries that got invaded and all the fucking black ops that we don't know about and all the people that got assassinated and all the people that. How about the Obama administration? How many people died from drone strikes that were innocent? It was in the 90% range. It was a lot of civilians, of innocent people that were died in these targeted, surgical drone strikes. Isn't that amazing term? You could use surgical for a missile with a bomb on the end. Very precise surgical breaks.
[ 0:07:55.000 ---> 0:07:56.000 ] Speaker B : Imagine again.
