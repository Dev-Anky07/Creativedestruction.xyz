[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker A : I keep going to baseball games and I love them, but the whole time I'm like, dude, if there's a foul ball, I'm getting the fuck out of the way. I'm so like, dude, dropping a foul ball. You know how embarrassing that is?
[ 0:00:12.000 ---> 0:00:21.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, it's scary. You could easily. Catching one with one hand is crazy. I've seen dudes catch line drives one hand. Everyone's like, yeah, hero.
[ 0:00:21.000 ---> 0:00:22.000 ] Speaker A : Hero, move.
[ 0:00:23.000 ---> 0:00:33.000 ] Speaker B : I've also seen people try to save their friends. I saw seeing people dive in front of the ball to save their friend when it's coming out of friend's head. Friend is like, on their phone and shit.
[ 0:00:33.000 ---> 0:00:33.000 ] Speaker C : Jesus.
[ 0:00:33.000 ---> 0:00:35.000 ] Speaker A : Taking it from a kid is fucking.
[ 0:00:35.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker B : Cracked by the ball.
[ 0:00:37.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : Dude. They used to let go. There was no nets down the third and first base line. Dude. Dudes would let go of the bat. There's a fucking hilarious image of this dude in the crowd getting hit with a bat.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:48.000 ] Speaker D : It's right here.
[ 0:00:48.000 ---> 0:00:50.000 ] Speaker A : His jaw is off his faces.
[ 0:00:50.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker B : I saw another one like that where a dude caught a bat, went flying. The dude fucking snatches the bat.
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker A : Really?
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:00:59.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, that's extinct because if you're at.
[ 0:00:59.000 ---> 0:01:02.000 ] Speaker A : A baseball game, 90% of the time, you're not paying.
[ 0:01:02.000 ---> 0:01:03.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I'm one of those.
[ 0:01:03.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker C : Freeze and kind of watch something bad happen.
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:11.000 ] Speaker B : What is this one? This is the bat one. There's a couple of bat ones. Oh, yeah. So this is the bat. The bat flies and dude snags it.
[ 0:01:11.000 ---> 0:01:13.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, and it's sharp. Dude, split.
[ 0:01:13.000 ---> 0:01:14.000 ] Speaker B : Hero. That guy's a hero. Look at him.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:15.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, my God.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:18.000 ] Speaker B : That's the greatest moment of his life. He caught that bat.
[ 0:01:18.000 ---> 0:01:22.000 ] Speaker A : Mother's talking shit standing up and look at homeboy.
[ 0:01:23.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker B : Everybody's freaking out. These guys, like, I got this shit. Snatch. One handed it.
[ 0:01:28.000 ---> 0:01:30.000 ] Speaker A : I mean, that thing could have hit a vampire.
[ 0:01:30.000 ---> 0:01:31.000 ] Speaker B : That's our leader.
[ 0:01:32.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker C : Vampire, dude.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:39.000 ] Speaker B : If we were a tribe, it was a tribe. That audience, that's our leader. That's the guy who caught the bat. Look at that animal. Yeah.
[ 0:01:39.000 ---> 0:01:42.000 ] Speaker A : You find that still image of that dude getting his fucking face.
[ 0:01:42.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker B : Do you know how good that guy must have felt, though? Hold that fucking bat up. Standing up like this in the whole.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:58.000 ] Speaker A : Audience, like, yeah, that must have been incredible. Yeah. Especially you didn't see it coming, right? Like, the closest thing we can get to adrenaline is, like, a good set. Yeah, this guy was just.
[ 0:01:58.000 ---> 0:02:00.000 ] Speaker B : This guy saved this kid.
[ 0:02:00.000 ---> 0:02:03.000 ] Speaker C : Look at the lady, dude.
[ 0:02:03.000 ---> 0:02:05.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my God. That kid was.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:05.000 ] Speaker D : Look at the mom.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:06.000 ] Speaker C : Look at the mom bailing.
[ 0:02:07.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : Damn. Look how jacked that dad is.
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:10.000 ] Speaker B : An animal size of that dude.
[ 0:02:10.000 ---> 0:02:11.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, shit.
[ 0:02:13.000 ---> 0:02:16.000 ] Speaker A : That's what I'm afraid of. I'm going to be the guy going.
[ 0:02:16.000 ---> 0:02:23.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, but look at the guy. Look at the guy to the right. Imagine a classical oil painting. That'd be a beautiful painting, dude. Look at the guy all the way to the right.
[ 0:02:24.000 ---> 0:02:25.000 ] Speaker B : That guy's still drinking his drink.
[ 0:02:25.000 ---> 0:02:27.000 ] Speaker D : Look, he's slurping.
[ 0:02:27.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker B : He's in the middle of slurping, dude.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:32.000 ] Speaker C : One guy's not even reacting. He's just sitting there like, whatever, dude.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:34.000 ] Speaker B : Is that a drink or popcorn or bowl?
[ 0:02:34.000 ---> 0:02:36.000 ] Speaker C : That's popcorn. He's got some popcorn.
[ 0:02:37.000 ---> 0:02:42.000 ] Speaker A : Now we're on to something. Yeah, find that lady getting racked in the face with a basketball.
[ 0:02:43.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker B : Is that her broken bat at Fenway Park? Oh, my God. Life threatening injuries.
[ 0:02:55.000 ---> 0:02:56.000 ] Speaker A : Look at the little kids eating pizza.
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:02:59.000 ] Speaker B : Took it. Look at the little girls, like, save me.
[ 0:03:00.000 ---> 0:03:02.000 ] Speaker A : That guy didn't even get his arms up.
[ 0:03:04.000 ---> 0:03:06.000 ] Speaker E : Sees it happening, bro.
[ 0:03:06.000 ---> 0:03:13.000 ] Speaker B : He got cracked. How bad that guy get injured? He's a little old to get hit in the head like that, too. Yeah, that might have done him in.
[ 0:03:13.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker A : Shattered jaw at the fucking. Sure.
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:24.000 ] Speaker B : At the least. I mean, I'm looking at that right now. That's like Anderson Silva hitting him with a left hook. Look at that snatch. That guy caught.
[ 0:03:30.000 ---> 0:03:34.000 ] Speaker A : The Indians game, dude, you're in fucking Cleveland.
[ 0:03:34.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker B : Look at that guy laughing. He's like, bro, this is sick.
[ 0:03:40.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker C : Look at that lady just looking with, like, morbid curiosity.
[ 0:03:42.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, that lady's a psycho.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:45.000 ] Speaker C : Look at her.
[ 0:03:45.000 ---> 0:03:46.000 ] Speaker B : She is staring down that bat.
[ 0:03:47.000 ---> 0:03:50.000 ] Speaker C : This shows your true, your deepest layer.
[ 0:03:50.000 ---> 0:03:51.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my God.
[ 0:03:51.000 ---> 0:03:52.000 ] Speaker E : Photos to snag, too.
[ 0:03:52.000 ---> 0:03:53.000 ] Speaker A : What's that?
[ 0:03:53.000 ---> 0:03:56.000 ] Speaker E : The photographer getting all that Cotton still all the movement.
[ 0:03:56.000 ---> 0:03:59.000 ] Speaker A : Every single one of those photographers went, dude, I got that.
[ 0:04:00.000 ---> 0:04:09.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, they have to be on point for that, right? They've got to be ready. That does happen. That guy's a fucking.
[ 0:04:09.000 ---> 0:04:10.000 ] Speaker A : That is amazing.
[ 0:04:10.000 ---> 0:04:14.000 ] Speaker B : Look at the size of the John Cena Arms on that motherfucker. That guy is a tank.
[ 0:04:14.000 ---> 0:04:15.000 ] Speaker E : This guy blew it.
[ 0:04:15.000 ---> 0:04:17.000 ] Speaker C : Imagine if he was doing like. Yeah, really? You got that, bro?
[ 0:04:17.000 ---> 0:04:19.000 ] Speaker B : Well, that looks like it's his kid.
[ 0:04:19.000 ---> 0:04:20.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, yeah, it's definitely his boy.
[ 0:04:20.000 ---> 0:04:22.000 ] Speaker E : Kid doesn't even see it.
[ 0:04:22.000 ---> 0:04:24.000 ] Speaker B : Look at the kid's face.
[ 0:04:24.000 ---> 0:04:29.000 ] Speaker A : He's playing fruit, using the force. That might not be his a.
[ 0:04:29.000 ---> 0:04:30.000 ] Speaker E : No, I think they're sitting next to.
[ 0:04:30.000 ---> 0:04:41.000 ] Speaker B : There's two kids. Look at the little girl. The little girl next to him. Smart as fuck. Look at her. She's like, down. Oh, maybe it might be the mom. Whoever it is, they just ducked. I doubt it's the mom.
[ 0:04:41.000 ---> 0:04:42.000 ] Speaker C : True.
[ 0:04:42.000 ---> 0:04:43.000 ] Speaker E : Yeah, not a good idea.
[ 0:04:43.000 ---> 0:04:48.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, that's the row in front of them. That's what that is right next to it. The dude is next to them.
[ 0:04:48.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker A : The black dude up there.
[ 0:04:49.000 ---> 0:04:55.000 ] Speaker C : Like, oh, I think moms have a thing innately where they genuinely can't get out of the way. Like they'll just stick their head.
[ 0:04:55.000 ---> 0:04:58.000 ] Speaker A : You ever drive with your mom in the car? Yeah, dude, anytime.
[ 0:04:58.000 ---> 0:05:00.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, they put their hand over every single time.
[ 0:05:00.000 ---> 0:05:02.000 ] Speaker A : Pretty sweet, actually. It's very nice.
[ 0:05:02.000 ---> 0:05:03.000 ] Speaker B : My wife does that to me sometimes.
[ 0:05:03.000 ---> 0:05:04.000 ] Speaker A : Very sweet.
[ 0:05:04.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker C : It's hilarious.
[ 0:05:06.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker B : A little bitch ass movement. How much strength do you think you have that way? Almost none. How much resistance do you have that backstroke?
[ 0:05:14.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker C : Do you ever test it? Do you ever buck her arm? Don't do that. You're in a hurry.
[ 0:05:18.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker B : Done it a couple of times, but she does it with the kids. Just a natural thing to do with kids. And they're hitting the brakes, but it's just like, you have zero power that way.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:30.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, focus on the fucking road. Hold the steering wheel.
[ 0:05:30.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker B : How much can you stop going in that direction with your arm outstretched like that? And you weigh 130 pounds?
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:05:50.000 ] Speaker A : I mean, this is going to be a very dark statement, but what that means every single time a mom's in a car accident with her kid, a severe one, she did go like this. The last thing she felt was, holy, he's going out.
[ 0:05:50.000 ---> 0:05:53.000 ] Speaker B : He's out the windshield. When I was a kid, we didn't wear seatbelts. Nobody wore seatbelts.
[ 0:05:53.000 ---> 0:06:05.000 ] Speaker C : No one at least all pretend. We would laugh. My parents would be like, you guys clicked in and we'd all go click with ouR, like, make the noise with our mouths. They'd be like, ha ha. And they laugh. My dad, when they started beeping, they just cut their seatbelts off and plugged them in.
[ 0:06:05.000 ---> 0:06:06.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, Jesus Christ.
[ 0:06:06.000 ---> 0:06:14.000 ] Speaker A : Seatbelts were gay, dude. Now they're not. I don't know what happened. Whoever did seatbelts, it used to be a seatbelt.
[ 0:06:14.000 ---> 0:06:15.000 ] Speaker D : You're a pussy.
[ 0:06:15.000 ---> 0:06:16.000 ] Speaker C : Kind of a pussy.
[ 0:06:16.000 ---> 0:06:19.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Like if you're a cool guy in a muscle car movie, you didn't have a seatbelt.
[ 0:06:19.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker A : When did that change what happened?
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:21.000 ] Speaker D : Even.
[ 0:06:23.000 ---> 0:06:26.000 ] Speaker B : Dudes would be driving in cars and they're not wearing.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker C : Imagine the Furies. Might have been seatbelt propaganda.
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, might have been the CCP.
[ 0:06:32.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker B : It could have been the CCP.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:35.000 ] Speaker A : They manufacture all the seatbelts.
[ 0:06:35.000 ---> 0:06:36.000 ] Speaker D : Probably.
[ 0:06:36.000 ---> 0:06:42.000 ] Speaker B : Do you come up with this, bro? This is Deep Paul Walker.
[ 0:06:44.000 ---> 0:06:48.000 ] Speaker A : Hold on, Jamie, will you find that old woman getting hit in the face with the basketball?
[ 0:06:48.000 ---> 0:06:49.000 ] Speaker B : No, we're done.
[ 0:06:49.000 ---> 0:06:54.000 ] Speaker A : No, I want to see this lady get hit in the face. It's a very funny video, and then we can find a new topic.
[ 0:06:54.000 ---> 0:06:57.000 ] Speaker B : There's nothing like rodeo guys getting stomped.
[ 0:06:57.000 ---> 0:07:00.000 ] Speaker A : Well, that's actually like death. Brutal.
[ 0:07:00.000 ---> 0:07:04.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, or running someone get hit by something.
[ 0:07:04.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker A : It's funny running the bulls, though. Rodeo guys, you're at least like, this is a sport.
[ 0:07:09.000 ---> 0:07:13.000 ] Speaker B : All this where there's only one person.
[ 0:07:13.000 ---> 0:07:15.000 ] Speaker A : Knows that participating running of the bulls has it coming.
[ 0:07:15.000 ---> 0:07:16.000 ] Speaker B : How does she get hit?
[ 0:07:16.000 ---> 0:07:19.000 ] Speaker E : So it'll happen once, and I get zoomed in just so you can see it.
[ 0:07:19.000 ---> 0:07:19.000 ] Speaker C : Okay.
[ 0:07:19.000 ---> 0:07:23.000 ] Speaker B : That's in real right in the mug.
[ 0:07:25.000 ---> 0:07:26.000 ] Speaker D : She wasn't looking.
[ 0:07:26.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker B : No, she wasn't looking at all. Looking at Facebook.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:32.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, it was like a chain email.
[ 0:07:32.000 ---> 0:07:36.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, boy. Oh, dude, look.
[ 0:07:37.000 ---> 0:07:38.000 ] Speaker A : Fuck.
[ 0:07:38.000 ---> 0:07:39.000 ] Speaker D : Fuck.
[ 0:07:40.000 ---> 0:07:42.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my God.
[ 0:07:42.000 ---> 0:07:43.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, my God.
[ 0:07:43.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker D : Look at him. Look at him. Look at him.
[ 0:07:45.000 ---> 0:07:45.000 ] Speaker A : Dude.
[ 0:07:49.000 ---> 0:07:51.000 ] Speaker C : He was trying to block it.
[ 0:07:51.000 ---> 0:07:51.000 ] Speaker D : Boom.
[ 0:07:51.000 ---> 0:07:53.000 ] Speaker A : She didn't even know what happened.
[ 0:07:53.000 ---> 0:07:56.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my God. Took a shot. Well, though.
