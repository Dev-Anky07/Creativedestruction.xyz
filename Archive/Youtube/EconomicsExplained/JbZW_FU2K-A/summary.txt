- Economics is sometimes called the dismal science. What is best for the individual is often not best for a society. The consequences of tough decisions, even if they are made with the best intentions, have cost billions of people throughout human history. How many billions have died over time because of poor economic policies?
- Economics as an academic discipline is currently in cris. The best that macroeconomists can do is learn from history. China failed to realize that industrial development leads to producing more steel. The proliferation of backyard furnaces were one of the primary drivers of the great Chinese famine. It shows the need to take economic policies very seriously.
