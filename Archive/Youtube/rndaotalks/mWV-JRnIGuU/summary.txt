- Daniel: I'm excited for a conversation with Thomas, who I know for now quite a few years. Thomas had some fantastic insights about network dynamics. And I thought it would be great to invite him to share some of his work with the Arendell crowd.
- Can I ask that everybody puts their video on, please? It's very disconcerting to talk to some empty pictures. It's just very we are learning how to communicate with each other. A human doesn't come alone, a human comes in the community.
- David Barrett: We are an ape species and we exist in networks. Every human society is automatically switching to networks. Structure of the network is essential to the health of the community. Barrett: How different a family is compared to friends.
- Dows aims to connect two problems, reputation and shared social connections. The first thing that will signal to you is the shared what's? Shared with others. Do you think that forms a danger if it gets into the wrong hands?
- Given that individuals are involved in multiple kinds of networks, what do you see as the implication of that for how we're relating to each other? A lot of what's going on in redesigning organizations is moving towards a space in which there is a space to create real relationships.
- There's a difference between being television and being an interaction or a radio. When I do TV work, I often have either somebody stand there or I need a human interaction, otherwise I can't. I'm not quite sure whether it is possible to have a two way bonding.
- Today we tend to have more fragmented networks. We belong to different networks which aren't as tight knit as they used to be. And I'm quite curious as to what is the impact on mental health.
- NASA study looked at how digital cooperation, online cooperation, can form. The most important factor that determined whether people are going to shirk on each other was how far their time zones were from each other. New systems would benefit from triggering real interaction as opposed to reputation.
- Thomas: Athena Ectopic's work on need based versus exchange based corporations. She found that there were two different kinds of exchange systems. People oscillate among these exchange systems, and behaviorally, they're quite different. Is there a way to hack this?
- Danny Cevallos: When we live in a society that is hierarchical, we use the position in the hierarchy to choose our friends. He says one of the worst type of marker is a status hierarchy. When the society changes, it might trigger continuous status anxiety, he says.
- The global society is emerging as one of the most unequal societies on the planet. We need to figure out how we are going to organize ourselves. And we also need to do that in a way that everybody is happy and in a highly connected network.
