- Stephen Wright: You never know, maybe we're all AI. He says it's called the demon theory. If you can't disprove it, then it can't be ruled out. Wright: It applies to governance in Dow, which is very new.
- This is a Twitter space about governance as it pertains to DAOs. My ask for you is if you could please share the space right now on your Twitter. Now, if you can also follow all the speakers, right? The best way to keep in touch with them is to follow them on Twitter.
- This is an open discussion on governance and DAOs. The format here is roundtable. I'll facilitate and probe discussions with questions, and then speakers and listeners can all join in. The topics are as broad as the perspectives are diverse. My hope is that we'll make some baby steps today towards a better tomorrow.
- There's about 15 speakers today, and let's obviously start with Steve at Dow Denver. We have Justice ETH, coming up with a lot of alternative perspectives on Dao formations and the concepts of priorities and governance. If you want to put your hand up, just add your hand to the queue.
- It's okay if we get off topic, but we'll try and keep things related to governance here. I can only have ten speakers at a time, so if you've requested to be a speaker, just put your hand up. The final rule and we dive in is have fun, right?
- What is your best example of a properly functioning governance model and why do you feel that way about it? Just put your hand up and I'll put you in queue to jump in. We'll get into more difficult questions later.
- The proper model for governance, I think, really comes down to the name of Dao. It's a new consensus algorithm that allows everyone to self validate their own voting and other functions. Do you have an example of a model that's using something like this that was very successful?
- I haven't seen any good successful model yet in twelve mature Impact Dows that we studied. What we did see in the smaller Impact house is about collective decision making. We need to figure out different decision making styles for different kinds of decisions.
- Dao space as an industry is still kind of zeroing in on best practices for governance. We essentially have an executive fund that the core team has centralized control over and a community fund that all the token holders vote on disbursements from. A lot of big decisions are being made on how to improve it or how to tweak it.
- Dow Governance Collective Telegram channel. Half of the people here are also in the group. I'm big supporter of delegated governance power. It will take time to improve the current status, but I think we will get there.
- Do you think the community should come before the protocol? Are they both more important or one of them's got to come first? If you have a thought on that, raise your hand and I'll bring you in.
- Good governance is communication about the future, our shared futures and what's going to happen to us or to you in that shared future. The things containing the most value are probably some of the best lighthouses to steal a term from. It's community.
- Mel: What you're saying touches a little bit on the last space we did about Dao leadership. And then there's this question of well, if everyone's got a different perspective, how to communicate that in a way that is empowering to the rest of the community. Daniel, if you wanted to jump in, I got you in queue anyway.
- Daniel: It's really key that we distinguish between the sort of top governance layer, let's say meta governance. And then what is operational governance like? More tactical or strategic. If we mix them together, it ends up being everything and nothing, or rather not functioning for anything.
- A project that has longevity and will be sustainable has a good balance of infrastructure and community. For a project to achieve longevity, there needs to be utility and community excitement and engagement. If anyone's got a secret magic formula to find that balance, let me know.
- Would you say that Bitcoin perhaps found the perfect balance of community and protocol, or do you think that that's a bad example and flowscience? If you have an answer and anyone else as well, that's listening.
- David Wheeler: I like to comment on your protocol versus community. He says for core matters that are critical to your mission, to your protocol, it should be decentralized. But then one needs to earn the right to vote and not have the entire community engage in the process. Wheeler: layered governance might be a better approach.
- I wanted to bring up Justin East because I just finished reading one of his articles. So Justin, if you want to dive in Mel, you can chime in right after. That's it. I wonder if we lost meme brains momentarily.
- I would replace that Language, the importance of the customer. What's a product without a customer or a user? And there is an Iterative method where you do something Small and you validate that people want it. Small founding Teams Deliver and then we can build out from there.
- When we talk about the concept of a small team delivering Justice, I wonder the way that I see it is you basically have a small founding team that helps create the mission. If people like it, then community forms. And community most because the user is always right.
- Next up is Mel, then the Thriller, then Daniel, then Arvin. In the sense that I think of the technology as almost artifact. Is it the artifact or is it the community? It kind of gets me to that turn.
- Mel Robbins: It's hard to talk about dow governance without talking about control theory tokenomics. Human to human is the ultimate sort of end state goal of any what I call process oriented interaction. Be careful about where you're drawing attention and try and keep communication very clear, concise, clean.
- Is it realistic to have a checklist to build a new community, a new Dow that has all the different options that the protocol could potentially have? For example, should the governance token have an open market value? Or should 100% of it go back to the community pool?
- The future of Dows is when you just add these three new capabilities to your list and then you pick from all the capabilities that are out there. Some of which will be much closer to the old way, some of which may be highly democratic. And that's where we'll have most of our success.
- Arvin: We need to start actually having a definition for community. He says it's so easy to forget It's all about building something people want. Arvin: Stop talking about community, start talking about product again. And then the community will come.
- Dow Governance Telegram Group for continuing. We're definitely looking for some more writers to help out summarizing some of this stuff. In real life we can hang out, go for a know, shake hands and meet up at Dow Denver.
- With that being said, I pretty much look at Dows as a lawyer, probably different than most people in the community. Constitutions basically Telling Members of a community what their basic Minimum Rights Are as part of that Community. If You Were to look at It as a business and I Think If you meet those minimum Requirements and More.
- Modern politics is one where if you want to affect change, you got to hurt people. There's got to be a better way to affectchange that doesn't involve hurting people. Using voting, using online, it happens to be being able to hit an Eject button.
- Joshua: Your checklist is not only possible, it is already there. Take any country's constitution. This is simply a manual of how things are done in that community. There is not a one size fits all. How can you make a community member who is really good at marketing make investment decisions?
- Not everyone is going to understand what they're voting for and why. If you have questions about proposals, tweet at somebody or go to the discord and ask a question from there. Just fork things and play and engage.
- Should governance tokens have a monetary price? Should governance be something that is able to be bought or maybe should it be earned? Should people be incentivized to participate, vote and build, or punished if they don't?
- We're building a Dao governed NFT marketplace on cardano. I'm trying to think about how to have really good open communication with Dao holders when it gets to be more fully fledged. I was thinking of maybe sending a small amount of Ada with a transaction.
- My current musings, I just dropped a piece about Quorum, the use of Quorum. I think a lot these days about accountability is sort of the required step change to get us to a place where we can self govern. I will be at Dow Denver. I saw my speaker application was accepted.
- Should governance tokens be monetized? Should somebody be able to buy governance? With money is that the community doesn't attribute legitimacy to that. Should there be a punishment mechanism or a disciplinary mechanism at that point? Absolutely yes.
- How do you transfer an old Dow into a new process? Do you have to start over? How do you teach an old dog new tricks? There's a lot to unpack. If you have a thought on this, please raise your hand.
- The monetary component I struggle with. The other thing too, that I think about is what is the overall acumen regarding that particular governance from the community. A lot of times we don't even know what it is that we're voting on. We just simply pick a side.
- I run the Citydow podcast. On one side, I just wanted to help and contribute to the Dow. On another side, to me, it's an education platform. If you're going to be in Dow Denver, we'll definitely make sure to try and meet up as well and keep this going.
- I'm an advocate for allowing a path to change. Even Ethereum, which is probably more dow than most dows, has a mechanism and a governance model that allows change. I would just recommend people don't build themselves into a corner and have a way to adapt with the times.
-  KR: I think it's very important, as you say, you need to adapt. I came across the Threshold network. It's a combination of two different protocols, keep and I think new. I really think we could learn a lot more about how to upgrade our dows.
- What are the metrics for decentralization when it comes to DAOs? When to delegate from the many to the few and how to do that. The question is how to differentiate or which ones to prioritize.
- When is that transition where at which point maybe to some extent there is some centralized governance and then there's that transition. As soon as Mel was talking about veto rights I would never imagine a scenario where I would be in favor of a few people sort of overriding the masses.
- An expert has more knowledge, wisdom than other people. But that person could actually present it to others. There's no need for centralized authority. It's just that expertise needs to be communicated to the Dao, to the community, for the community to vote on.
- Veto ability is one of the fundamentals of checks and balances. The veto should be applied on divergence from the agreed upon terms of interaction. To just veto something because you don't want it would perhaps destroy a community.
- Most powerful thing they can do is veto. They can veto anything for any reason. And I think that's what the other gentleman was talking about is making sure that the vetoes that we would instill in a Dao would be limited to the core function of the Dow.
- The frequency at with which decisions are made in the space combined also with the traditional executive power is a really, I think, interesting area for innovation. I think that I'm making a plea basic sort of normalize the idea of executive leadership stepping down not necessarily rage quitting.
- This is intended to be just a safe, neutral territory where we can all come and discuss differing opinions on these critical topics for the ecosystem. We'll be wrapping up pretty soon here for this particular space. Remember to join the Dow governance. Telegram chat.
- Coy: Local self governance, the speed with which a bad actor can be removed, is one of the core design principles of successful governance. He says the way to govern dysfunctional governments is to govern ourselves a little bit better. Coy: We have a lot more tools than we used to have. We'll keep trying.
- David: Ecosystem number one and the governance. My background is international education innovation in the education and technology education. How can we make efficiency working properly? And contact and network with anyone on the Dow Denver team. We're really excited to bring this.
- How do we make these systems effective? By testing them out in a lab using gate theoretical models. For example, I'm really curious about experimenting with Smart contract enabled auto signatures. If you want to share a link in the thread here, it'll be a good closing.
