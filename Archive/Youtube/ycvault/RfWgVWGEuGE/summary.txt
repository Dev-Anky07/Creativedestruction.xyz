- At Zappos, the first core value was to deliver while through service. How do you sort of create a set of values and define the culture? The values have to support your mission and be uniquely tied to your mission.

-  Airbnb has a great culture and also a great brand. Brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with. There's no such thing as a good or bad culture. It's either a strong or weak culture. How do you know how to communicate this to the company?
- How do we make sure the hosts are enforcing the culture of airbnb? We do a pretty good job, but not yet an amazing job at it. Over time, we've realized hosts are partners and so they need to believe in the same values. Now we have a program called the super host program.
- Airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community. Do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to the culture on your company? We tend to be a pretty open culture.
- Airbnb founder: It's better to have 100 people that love you than to have a million people that just kind of sort of like you. The first thing we do is get the perfect experience for one person. Then we use a separate part of our brain to imagine now how will we achieve that at scale.
- A lot of people think that this is not necessarily a technology company, but it's more of a marketing company. Airbnb has to figure out how to be international. We have to be world class at technology. And we have to convince people, this isn't crazy.
