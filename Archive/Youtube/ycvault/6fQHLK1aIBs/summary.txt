- Building a company is much more difficult than forging a product. Basic reason is people are irrational. Eventually you want to construct a high performance machine. This is basically a performance machine that idiots can run.
- There's only one book ever written that actually explains how to do this. It's written in 1982 by Andy Grove. His definition of what your job is is to maximize the output of an organization. You want to focus on the output, not the input.
- If you have too much process, too much predictability, you're probably not innovating fast enough and creatively enough. The most important task of an editor is to simplify, simplify, simplified. The more you simplify, the better people will perform.
- The job of an editor is to ensure a consistent voice. Ideally, your company should feel like on your website, in your PR release, on your packaging. Almost every company has at least one piece of the organization that isn't exactly on the same voice.
- The next complicated topic is delegating. The problem with delegating is that actually you're responsible for everything. How do you both delegate but not abdicate? Your management style needs to be dictated by your employee.
- The next and most possibly most important thing you do is actually edit the team. What you need in your company are barrels. And you can only shoot through the number of unique barrels you have. Usually when you hire more engineers, you don't get that much more done.
- How do you figure out who's a barrel and who's not? One is you start actually with a very small set of responsibilities. What you want to do is keep expanding it until you see where it breaks. Some people will surprise you.
- Every company has its own growth rate and every individual has their own growth rates. First thing I'd recommend is building a dashboard. You really need to spend a lot of time focusing people.
- Everybody in your company absolutely should have access to every single thing that's going on. Other things that I like to do are take your board decks and review every single slide with every single employee. I think you could push the envelope a lot more.
- You want to measure outputs, not inputs. You should draft the dashboard to tie this all together. If you measure one thing and only one thing, the company tends to optimize to that. The people responsible for that team need to be measured on both.
- You don't actually want to look for the expected behavior. A famous example was at PayPal, where 54 power sellers handwritten into their ebay listings. Similarly, at LinkedIn, a stat that made no sense to me was people looking at themselves in the mirror. We wouldn't have found that without looking for anomalous data.
- The final topic I want to talk about is details. If you get all the details right, you don't worry about how to build a billion dollar business. The office environment that people live in and work in every day dictates your culture.
- How would you make compensation transparent? I would do it in probably bands. The way Steve did it, actually, at Next was there was a high band and a low band. If you're super experienced, everybody gets paid like 130,000.
- When you're in a startup environment, how do you optimize those things? Resources are scarce. You must have your own office. It's really hard to create a cult if you're sharing space with people. What's most important in a high quality office that creates a good vibe.
- Almost all good managers in Silicon Valley are promoted because of their individual performance. One of the first things people don't get right is their time allocation. Find a mentor who will work with you, not your boss.
- I would look at every piece of copy in every department. Treat customer support like a product so that you actually have an engineering team and a design team over time that actually focuses on making that world class. Most executives were trained differently at different companies. You've got to cross train that.
- You should have a one on one roughly every two weeks. The agenda should be crafted by the employee who reports to the manager. When is it acceptable to compromise and hire someone who is ammunition rather than a barrel?
- As a venture capitalist, how often do I interact with my companies meet with them. When we invest a fair amount of money and lead around like a Series A or Series B round, I meet with the founder CEO every two weeks. Actually, surprisingly, I do a lot by text message.
- Every company will move recruiting 1st, second, or third, somewhere in that sort of spectrum. If it's your number one priority, then about 25% is probably a pretty good allocation. I like the calendar audit for CEOs, even more so than for new managers.
- On the surface, some of this advice seems contradictory because you've emphasized focusing on A plus tasks and delegating less important things. How do you harmonize those goals? The underlying philosophy of getting the details right is important to install in the very, very beginning of a company.
