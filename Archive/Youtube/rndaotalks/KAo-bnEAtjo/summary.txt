- Angela and John are some of my mentors in cybernetics and systems thinking. Both have tremendous experience, well over three decades each in these fields. John has 35 years of experience in the cooperative business sector. So very much looking forward to what you guys have to share about this topic.
- The Viable System Model is a comprehensive theory of organization based on principles from natural systems. It bases organization on individual autonomy and creativity and frees people up in a particular context in order to work effectively. The course aims to reach out to your community with some of the ideas that we've been working with for decades.
- VSM says you must adapt quickly and effectively and this means real time information. This is not about authority and obedience, command and control. It's about giving people as much autonomy as they can, but always within the constraints of system cohesion.
- The VSM is both centralized and decentralized at the same time. Stafford designed these five systems. The best way to think about this is to divide any viable system into two bits. If you start working these things together as a whole, you get all these opportunities.
- The decentralized autonomous units of Dows must work together in a cohesive whole. That's why it's also needed the meta or management system as well. When you start working together there's just so much more you can achieve.
- Danielle: I am a computer and systems engineer who abandoned programming and computers when I did my PhD in organizational cybernetics. I am completely fascinated with learning about Dows and I am really thankful with Danielle because that's giving me an excuse to go deeper.
- Both theories came from the inspiration of the understanding of organizations as neural networks. Dows takes the idea of a decentralized autonomous organization very much. VSM is more related with the way that the brain interacts with the body. So there is no surprising that there are very complementary things in which they are different.
- Blockchain has the potential to completely transform organizations using cryptocurrency. Idea of smart contracts and consensus algorithms is fundamental for automation. BSM is member owned organizations with no centralized leadership. Only way to have a completely decentralized, self regulated neural network kind of organization.
- If we wanted to expand massively the idea of Dows to design meta mega organizations worldwide, the other interesting comparison is between governance. Rather than a corporation, a Dow may end up functioning like a kind of general partnership that opens a really interesting field for organizational design.
- Both Holocracy and sociocracy have very deep roots in cybernetics theories of organization. One model that comes to my mind is Olacracy organizational model. I wouldn't discard the possibility of exploring the VSM as well to go deeper into these theories.
- The VSM is the only one I've come across that can map everything, all the other theories onto it. All the others are like almost VSM light in various different approaches. But they don't distinguish between systems four and five, which for me opens all sorts of problems.
- Hi there. I run a food systems business in Jersey. I'm wondering how does the changing in size of the environment so the need for food, et cetera. How do these impact the discussions, the theoretical discussions? Because these feel very real within the food system discussions.
- The VSO is the perfect vehicle in this situation because you bring them together into a network. One of the basic principles of the VSM is the idea of managing variety, having requisite variety. How do you develop this capability of adaptation?
- The main unique thing about DAOs is that people own the Dao. The best and most productive way of applying the VSM is if you develop an organization that is member owned. But in practical terms we have seen many applications of the BSM in other types of organizations.
- Can I just ask a question in this context because I've been involved in co ops all my life. The thing that I'm surprised about is that you give more influence to people who've got more tokens which is fundamentally completely alien in a co op. Most Dows are facing challenges on having coherence on the System Five issues.
- There's an extraordinary example in the Basque country in northern Spain. Mondragon, which should be on the reading list of every management course in every university in the world. Another example is the idea of using the VSM to design multi agencies. BSM is an ideal theory to try to create networks.
- Angela Stafford: This is my first contact with VSM, and it's really interesting. My question too is this from your experience of studying probably hundreds cases of case studies. Is there one or a few factors that more often than not contribute to communities that you have studied not working?
- So, Angela and John, we're essentially out of time. A fantastic presentations. And thank you everyone for participating in this discussion. Could I ask you to share your presentations with me if that's okay with you. Have a lovely rest of the day and hopefully see you soon.
