- Andrew: I hope you don't mind me jumping in here and saying hi to everyone while you set up at Citidao. I'd love it if we got more people to jump in here. If anyone out there is feeling it too, obviously no obligation. I think we should be supporting the team and everyone else who's putting this together.
- This is a Twitter space about building the future of civilization. It's an open discussion on the network state of DAOs, of startup societies and all things that are related. We have nine official speakers today, so pretty excited about that. I'll be in charge of the mute button.
- If you want to speak or you have a question, just put your hand up inside the Twitter space. Let the other person finish before you begin speaking. I can only have ten speakers at a time. Please be patient if we don't get to you right away.
- Andrew at Origami Dow helps ambitious communities launch and grow their DAOs. They brought me on to just expand the Dow ecosystem to talk more about DAOs that exist. I want to evangelize them and get more people excited about them.
- Venture capitalists are exploring the idea of creating a dao to invest. Dows are new. Everyone's talking about the legal and regulatory issues around them. From a legitimacy point of view, I think we're going to see them invest in other DAOs too.
- The fund that makes the investments and the other is the Dow. The fund does kick its profits back into the Dow so that the Dow does get to grow its treasury. This is the structure that we've found that works best for allowing the investments to work well together.
- Next up, let's do an intro from Kiftdao. They launched the Kiffdao and launched a network of co living houses for Nomads. We'll be expanding to tiny homes with some exciting announcements coming this year. Let us know your biggest one or two successes from 2022 for Kiftao.
- There's a Dow that's sort of funded separately, but you also have a monthly membership that allows access. One exciting thing we're working on, 2023 is to purchase our first community owned property. Are you guys break even because of that or I'm just curious.
- Zach Caseris is a passionate and very knowledgeable person about startup cities. Next down the list is how about we go to Yoni Babochi. Misa if you can help bring Zach in as a speaker as well.
- Cabin is a network of co living neighborhoods for creators and nature loving remote workers. In terms of biggest successes in 2022, we've added a few neighborhoods to our network. From what I can see on the outside, you have this steady, stable approach to getting these properties working.
- Zach CASER: My biggest success of 2022 is, well, early 2022. I brought startupcities. com back from the dead. I've also got a job board in the works. If any of you are in Denver for the big Ethereum event, I'd love to meet y'all.
- Is there a difference between a startup society or a startup city versus a network state? So network states focus on sourcing demand from the cloud, whereas startup cities follow this more siphon oriented model. And we'll dive into that a little deeper again here today.
- Yoni Babochi is the founder of Layer Hailing from Tirana in Albania. One of the main things he wants to do at Layer is how can we optimize bottom up interventions in a city. If you have questions that pop up when you're hearing, note it down.
- Next, let's go with Angelo from Build cities. Build Cities is a protocol for startup cities. We're building infrastructure for innovators and communities to incubate develop and kind of sustain startup ecosystems anywhere in the world. What are your top two successes from 2022?
- So thanks again for having I'm sorry to interrupt. You got to hit that bottom chat button and start posting some links to what you talked about. I see a few people are egging me on to ask some more information, including Rico. So thank you guys.
- Angelo: You're starting to get a sense of the broad diversity inside this network state and startup city ecosystem. And for me, one of the inspiring aspects that kind of led to doing this Twitter space was to open up channels. If you could help bring Lewis in as a speaker, I'll skip over to Cohere.
- Dakota Pastelou is a co founder of Cohere network. Cohere provides access of direct equity to the company itself. Company is a C Corp registered in Delaware type situation. Will eventually be launching a Dow on the governance side.
- Luis from Nation Three is working on software that allows a decentralized jurisdiction to exist. You can rely on network estate for all your legal documents. What was your biggest success of 2022? And I'm really curious about your year as well.
- Eric: Walter, why don't you introduce yourself and your project and your biggest success of 2022? Walter: I'm an attorney, an attorney and a futurist. I've been working on the idea of what I call tiny cities since about 2013. I'm really excited for 2023.
- Tasia, we just need to add you as a speaker. Arvin is I met Arvin recently. And I actually specifically left you more towards the end, Arvin, because you inspired me to organize a Twitter space like this.
- Arvin Dow: My biggest success in 2022 has been talking to some organizations that are large organizations in the crypto world. He says they put their projects aside because of the market sentiment, but now they want to start again. Arvin: What could it look like if we had more decentralized side of things into social media?
- Tasia is the CTO over at the Sapien Network. Her goal is to enable the building of network states. The key is to cross that barrier to adoption, there needs to be a bull market. If you have a question, all you have to do is raise your hand.
- How do you successfully govern a network state? Or let's say a startup? If you have ideas or input on these, you can put your hand up anytime and add to them.
- Walter: I'm super excited for all of the more streamlined onboarding tools that are being built. Beyond the tool side, beyond the tech, the piece that we're really focused in on is the people side, the culture side and what. We totally agree that there needs to be a roadmap for the founding team.
- Next up, we have and cabin. If you want to go ahead, ask your question or add your comment. How do you govern a network state? The best way to govern it is we're going to have to re educate people.
- Andrew from Origami. I'm going to try to help Meme Brains cycle through a lot of speakers. Misa has been in the background here on the official Citidao channel helping with the speaker rotation. I would love it if some people here did what I've been doing and others have to bring more people into network states.
- We're currently vetting what the best software stack is for Dao Tooling. If you guys have good recommendations on the best place to find all the right tools, I would love to consult that resource. Anyone that wants to reach out to Crystal grave, you just do so.
- And let's jump over to arvin was next up with his hand up. And then Lewis arvin, if you want to, go ahead. And also, to this software question, when I was doing my research on Dows, I saw there are a bunch of websites out there. I'll put one in the chat right now.
- Arvin: Starting with a centralized organization where there is a leader and then eventually give away that title to the community. What's really important in timing is when the problems that the founder started solving are solved. Then there's a foundation built for the people to actually take it on and build something with it.
- How do you govern a network? Anyone in the community who holds Cabin token can propose a quest. Once funded, a quest team has full autonomy to operate independently from the rest of the Dow. The balance between getting stuff done and also allowing the community's voice to be heard is a delicate one.
- We're starting to imagine the first Civilization scale game that's played online and offline. Our first call of the season is this Monday on January 9. We have co living experiences in Colombia, Portugal, Texas, and California available still.
- Blockboy: I don't think we should ever unlearn what happens in the past, because the mistakes of the past is how we kind of create the present. How do we govern network states? How could we create the best feedback loop between laws and stories?
- How can we bring crypto to creating network estates? The only thing that we are really trying to get right is actually checks and balances and building a strong system of law. To create it, the only way you have is through strong governance.
- I want to hear what Citidao is planning for this coming year and what you're thinking about as far as creating a network state. If anyone listening here thinks that network states won't work, think about why and raise your hand.
- Citidao is an experimentation with decentralized land ownership and how that works in the real world. Anyone in the community that has an NFT, no matter where you are, can propose a project and do something with it. We bought our second piece of land in Colorado.
- Eric: One problem that I've been seeing with network States is bad and non existent marketing. He says we need to do a much better job of doing dramatic marketing. Eric: How do we do better promotion together? Let's brainstorm.
- Abela aims to advance special economics states in Nigeria. One of the challenges we have in the space is clarity of concepts between startup cities. Cesare says Network State is an exitarian concept. He says there's no alignment between network state freedom and its alignment in real life.
- Ashim: The best marketing tool is great showcase projects like Kift and Citidao. He says Web Three needs to do a better job promoting. Ashim: We need to get better at communicating at a scale.
- Moondao is a Dao that's focused on building a network of people that all share the same dream of becoming multiplanetary. What are you doing to get more attention?
- One of the biggest challenges that I see right now in crypto is that everyone that's participating in it has a high level of intellectual capability. How do we actually build decentralized conceptual systems for people to input on and turn that into meaningful action?
- What can someone do today to increase the quality of their culture? What does culture really mean? How do we know if it's a good culture? Where is the line between debate versus toxic culture? There's a question and frio.
- The culture code. Such a hot topic. And anyone that has questions or comments around what can you do today to increase the quality of the culture in your Dao or organization, just raise your hand. In the queue we have next up we have Walter, then Neural Earth, Dao, then Abiola, then Kiff.
- Eric Liu: The idea of culture for me surrounds a lot, the idea of incentives. Are the incentives built for civility? And you've built good incentives here, Eric. How do we go about doing that at a larger scale?
- We really need to work on getting people to engage within the Dao. How do we incentivize people to show up? And if we can't, that's a big problem. The best marketing internally and externally is getting people together in real life.
- "We should start a thread. We should keep connected on that and do something in person. Maybe it's I'm not sure exactly what it is yet, it's kind of a random idea " Just send me a DM if you want to be involved in an IRL meeting in Denver at East Denver.
- We've decided to do our initial offering on the XRP Ledger. Rocket Launch has built a decentralized automated marketing tool. It uses Telegram and their community and Telegram to establish trust lines and liquidity for our coin. It might be worthwhile to mimic Rocket Launch's tool that they've designed.
- The IRL component has been pivotal in solidifying the connection and energy of our community. All of the opportunities that we are providing for our members are laying the foundation essentially for a new way to live. If you want to chime in, feel free.
- What is the most important, top priority in your Dow that has to get done as a Dow in the next 30 days? What is one thing you can do to increase the quality of a culture in your organization? I'd love to hear from you.
- The concept of Dows has, I think, become more important now, especially in my understanding of what's going on than ever before. So I sort of just recently started toying with this idea, trying to find out more about it.
- Citidao is trying to introduce a new way of governing land, countries, states, and introduce that accountability, whether it's by voting or whatever it happens to be. Where's the eject button for dysfunctional politicians in our current governing systems? Building towards accountability, cost efficiency and powerless.
- If you start to get people who are actual decision makers for their community, and I mean real life communities, it's very real. The outcome of what you're trying to define can affect people's real life. Maybe Kift is going to be our last speaker today and we're going to take this momentum and build towards the next one.
- Kift aims to create options outside of our current capitalistic model of society. Part of this Twitter space is about education. It's about connecting us all together. I'll be posting out when the next time is for the next Twitter space and I really hope to see you all there.
