- Peter Thiel was the founder of PayPal and Palantir and Founders Funds. And he's going to talk about strategy and competition. Thanks Sam for inviting Peter.
- To create a valuable company you have to basically both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value of what you've created. If you compare the US airline industry with a company like Google on search, airlines are still more important than search.
- There are two kinds of businesses in the world. There are businesses that are perfectly competitive and those that are monopolies. This dichotomy is not understood very well. It's the most important business idea.
- The lies people tell about their businesses are often in opposite directions. The basic lie you tell as a non monopoly is that we're in a very small market. The real difference, I would submit, is actually quite big.
- If you're a startup, you want to get to Monopoly. How do you get to a large share of a market? You start with a really small market and you take over that whole market. Over time, you find ways to expand that market in concentric circles. Often the idea is to go after small markets.
- Most of the value in tech companies exists far in the future. The characteristics of monopoly, proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale are important. This last mover thing is very critical.
- The history of science has generally been one where Y is 0% across the board. And so it's very rare where people make money. Only two broad categories in the entire history of the last 250 years where people have actually come up with new things and made money.
- These rationalizations always obscure this question of creating x dollars in value and capturing y percent of X. The history of innovation has been this history where the microeconomics, the structure of these industries has mattered a tremendous amount. And we shouldn't just rationalize that away.
- We find ourselves very, very attracted to competition in one form or another. There is always this question about competition as a form of validation. When lots of people are trying to do something that is often proof of insanity. Competition does make you better at whatever it is.
- The question I always try to focus on is what is the actual market. Which of the aspects of Monopoly would you say stop for companies like Google Excel? How do young innovators have inspiration to create complex systems that last?
- How would you recommend rethinking sort of that competitive? I do think this tendency for us to see competition as validation is very deep. I think it actually does afflict all of us to a very profound degree. Never underestimate how big a problem it is.
