- Today's talk mainly relates to my scientific work that I do as part of the PhD program that I'm currently completing. And it all relates to studying the spontaneous activity in human brain organoids to better understand information processing in the brain. If you have any questions at the end, we'll have some time for questions.
- In my lab we work with human brain organoids. An organoid is an organ like tissue that is grown in the lab. It contains of different cell types that are all organ specific. Out of nowhere, these organoids start to send signals to each other. That's what I studied.
- Bezat: I study brain organoids so you could almost see it as mini brains. We place those on arrays with electrodes that we can use to record the activity. Special interneurons show that these organoids are much more closely resembling an actual brain.
- Daniel: One of the ways in which I'm interested in using organoids is studying what that activity could look like before any information comes in. Another paper that I'm finalizing is almost ready looks at that. How the brain structures its spontaneous activity to optimally process information.
- We also use these organoids to look at pharmacological treatments. We look at treating organoids with certain pharmacological compounds to see how that changes the activity in the organoid. This is still a really early and young field because the majority of or basically we're one of the first labs that studies this activity in organoids.
- From here I've been very interested in the concept of network biomimicry. What I am currently working most with is brain networks. But before that I also looked at protein networks and ecosystem networks. What can we learn from that to improve our people networks?
- Do you have the ability to kind of measure the lifespan of a neuron in order to see whether a neuron that has been there for longer is more active within the network? Does it eventually just die off?
- The varying extent of activity and the number of connections. Another one is the varying extensive plasticity. Other brain networks are just like protein networks and ecosystem networks. These are just some examples of what you can find in nature. If there's any more questions, then this is a great time to ask them.
- I have a question with regards to how we're using this within together crew. One thing that we now currently have quite present within our dashboard is the moderate amounts of fragmentation initially. For more of an academic research project where we look closer at some of the more advanced network metrics.
- When organoids die, the whole thing dies. And so there's no new networks that then form. Neurons can only be formed from stem cells. And it's really easy for them to die in the brain.
- The lab where I work is mainly focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Things you can do to prevent it are like living a healthy life. It's mostly a prevention through Holistic. Health is the best way to treat your brain.
- The field of organoids is still really young or specifically like studying neural activity in organoids. We do grow them, in our case from human cells, but you can also grow them from cells from other animals. Currently, the field is still so young.
- Where do you see this going? The whole science and also the business application of it. You can use these to do experiments that are much harder to do on live animals. Can these organoids be conscious? Can they be used to study consciousness? And also more science fictiony ideas of using organoids for computation.
- In the latest update from Neuralink they also presented they use organoids to test their devices. Could you outsource some computation and get the results directly back into your brain? In theory, it could be possible. But there might be unforeseen obstacles that make that take a lot longer than we can imagine.
- All right, we're at the hour, so unless any last questions, I think we need to let people go. And thank you all for your questions. This was fun.
