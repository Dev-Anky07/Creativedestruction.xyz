- Risk finance is a DeFi options protocol. Effectively the way it works is an AMM for option. Currently we have like GMX integration and others uniswap Bridgetrade. Looking into Perennial as well to basically edge position for liquidity providers.
- Dopex is a decentralized options exchange. The aim is to maximize liquidity for writers and then minimize losses. We have a lot of changes that are upcoming with our V two, so it's going to be really interesting to hear a little bit more on that later.
- Luke: One of the big things I'd love to hear your opinion on is the difference between we see a lot of popularity within the perpetual side, right? However, on the other side, retail users and stocks and things like that love to use options. What are some of the challenges for options and why they haven't gained popularity?
- There's so much more focus on community. Focus on the different target audiences. The educational barrier to the options space really. I think we're eventually going to see that transition on chain.
-  Professionals Protocol is one of the most competitive vertical in crypto. Main challenges when you're first getting an exchange off the ground is like bootstrapping liquidity. How teams can succeed going forward is primarily through their distribution channels.
- Dan, how has the risk beyond sort of program been the new launch? Is there anything else that you're looking forward to for the next remainder of this year? So far it's been great. Now it's a matter of making sure we keep improving the product first.
- Bella, for the Dopex V Two update that's coming, can you share anything about that with us today? I think the light paper is going to be released very soon and there's also a testnet very soon. We will definitely announce it within one or two weeks. It's going tobe a game changer.
- V Two introduces a whole host of capital efficiency benefits. We'll be releasing a whole new UI overhaul, an advanced LP interface. We're moving to become an Oracle Agnostic model mechanism. Excited to see a lot of interesting long tail markets come out.
- And Alan, I may have heard that you guys are doing something on the LP front where people can actually provide liquidity even though you're not an AMM Dex. Can you share a bit more about that and any other product updates you have?
- But yeah, that's all from me. It was wonderful speaking with you guys. Thanks. Bye.
