- It sounds strong, but it does sound like a little bit gruff. Are you coming down with a cold? Maybe I need to turn something up. Do I sound better? How's that?
- Host: Keep tweaking your rodecaster. I never have been able to get the sound I want out of it on spaces. Let's get some more people up here. Just don't drown out some of our guests.
- All right. We're going to move right into these discussions. I sent Victor an invite. If you aren't getting the invite, just send us a request. We'll get you up here with us again.
- Busy, busy day of spaces today is an understatement. It's nonstop since 06:00 a. m. We're going to get into these proposals. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion, not representative of the Apecoin foundation.
- Three proposals up for vote this week. Apecoin Dow AIP ambassador and mentorship program. Reallocation of ecosystem fund into Ethereum and USDC AIP 355 SSP. If you see something and you want to talk about it, retweet it.
- AIP 344 is the moving gallery for the Dow proposed here by Victor T. Tatcher. The proposal aims to create 13 hand sculpted apecoin and otherwise yugo related art pieces. Some places already have agreed to display these pieces over the next six months to one year after the proposal would be approved.
- AIP 355 suggests reallocating 10% of the Dow's available fund into 5% of Ether and 5% USDC. Funds would be utilized for different activities related to operating the apecoin Dow. Program will pair successful AIP authors with first time applicants to help push proposals forward.
- If you want to ask a question, jump up here with us. I'm just looking at the steps to implement and the timeline as I do when asking questions. And if anybody else wants to jump in, just being mindful that AC may jump at any time.
- So you've got week one to two as drafting guidelines and finalizing an AIP scoring template. There's seven sections on the AIP draft template, but only three are shown on snapshot. Looking to provide a proof of concept back to the Dow when the program concludes.
- How are you planning to pick some of the approved authors to coordinate with you other than those who reach out. I think involving the community as best as we possibly can is always the move lost. There's a lot of different ideas. Once something's in writing on an AIP, it's very difficult to change.
- After this three month period, are you looking to submit another proposal? Are you looking for this to have funding? Do you have any broad thoughts on where this might go after that first three months?
- Will this sit inside the governance working group as an ongoing service to the Dow? Is this something that would also fall into a thank ape sort of a concept? I would love to see this become part of our next budget. It's not fleshed out fully yet.
- This was actually born out of a Thankape idea a thon. I would love that opportunity. Experienced people within that team, the marketing behind it, so much fun. Would love to work with.
- Victor and his AIP 344 all city. Did you want to give any closing statements here regarding your proposal? And if you guys haven't voted, you have till Wednesday. 06:00 p. m. PST to get your votes in.
- The proposal is to onboard new members into the Dow beyond web three. It is targeted to new people that do not even know what Dow is. The idea is to have a QR code which they would scan, and then that would bring them into a short video about the Dow.
- The ones you see on the pictures are pieces from Menchaka Studio. They use this strategy to first use shopping centers and then go into private galleries and then to museums. The timeline seems pretty incredible to me, too. You're looking to do all of this within four months.
- AIP authors can scan something and it can bring people to. Same could be done for an ERC 20. What Victor is talking about is already done. And, oh, we need pictures. We need to send Aaron out there to get some. We got to get you to post them.
- After two years, the ownership would transition at no cost to the DAO through a future DAO Aip. Or the team could continue to manage them through another AIP as well. All of the sculptures can then be raffled into members that voted in the AIP.
- When they scan the QR code, they go into a short video about what the apecoin is. The whole point of the idea is to bring new members and new educated members. Is this something that you work with, let's say the market and communications stewards working group?
- SSP: These things could be multipurposed and become assets of the DAO that could be used variously. One thing is that creating storytelling through metaverse experience. The more that I can create that suspension of disbelief and the engagement.
- More than half of the pieces would be the apecoin logo in different versions. The pieces will be able to be disassembled and to be shipped flat. The whole idea of the proposal is to get new members into it. I think more cool art will really get our message out there.
- There's six different apecoin schools. Would it just be branded with the apecoin logo and colors? Or might there be some other designs for these? Have you thought about tokenizing sculptures?
- Ssp. Victor: Good discussion, good feedback from the community. Thanks so much for having me in the space. If someone else has another idea or more feedback, please send it to me through DM.
- Lord, Lord, Lord. What happened, bro? You sound all out of energy. You're dying on us. I'm going to write an AIP loss cannot die. Fix it up. Are we ready to go on the next AIP?
- Sword, AIP 355, the reallocation of ecosystem funds into Ethereum and USDC. Although it doesn't look like it will pass as is, we've got some valuable feedback from it. There's some merit with every piece of feedback you heard.
- Mike: How about we just take 10% and do this great conversation? Mike: This would be better put forward by a bunch of people than one, two, three, or four people. It's a larger conversation that needs to be had in the ecosystem eventually.
- SSP: This might be something that falls under our project managers, like the governance or a future treasury group. There is just a lot of discretion here for the foundation. Really talking about how it could expand the operations of the foundation would probably be beneficial.
- You've got until Wednesday at 06:00 p. m. PST to get your votes in. Otherwise we've got plenty of posts up. We're going to be reaching out to so many of you over the next week or so to coordinate another stage. We want people to not have so much friction in this process.
- There are many people in the community who don't agree with what the role is or what it's become. If you wanted to change it, you've got to put a proposal up. We'll do it Wednesday. Lost is going to read 29 bullet points of facts from the Ape foundation.
- Apecoin admin account created by Webslinger to deliver transparent communication between the foundation and the Apecoin community. Aaron: It is not hard to find what the responsibilities of the special counsel are currently. I'm hoping that my single issue helps to kind of spark. lively debates and discussions.
- Uzi had his hand up. Maybe he wanted to respond to something that you said about reading out 29 bullet points of some really boring text. I agree with obviously making the application myself. Record the spaces so we can all listen to it at like double speed.
- AIP Roundup: SSP is literally the Kanye west candidate in the special counsel election. Some people are confused with their own roles. It would be great if everybody in the community had no confusion. Now I think it's time to remove that confusion.
- I want more people to talk about where special counsel and how, basically, how kind of what I call SC stands for scope creep. The debate or the discussion about centralization and decentralization, it could go on forever.
- The communications has been an issue in the apecoin dow for the longest time. Is messaging and narrative and marketing communications needed? Absolutely, 100%. If you are elected, I run with you. It's an actual AIP that puts the board, in my opinion, where it belongs.
- Uzi: I just think that it needs to be read under the umbrella of stewardship and oversight. Planning for sustainability of ape foundations and apecoin dows operational expenses. That doesn't sound like a board to me. Personal opinion not representative of the Apecoin foundation.
- 10% of the eight point treasury. Could be done using swap v three concentrated liquidity lps. But for now, you need to rewrite it. A more fleshed out version is probably the way to go.
- The apecoin special council members that go in there got to do everything. You better come on spaces and report everything you do. And then the thing that I expect is that they are actually there to get rid of their own position. Just delegate your votes to me.
- If anybody feels a little bit bad about voting no against their friends, aips and stuff, just delegate to me so you could have an excuse. Read the proposals very carefully, and if you don't understand them, vote against. Then vote yes on everything.
- The community is sick of the old guard and they want new stuff. Because those expectations are set, we're expecting even more from the future council members. We want you guys to come overachieve and beat the last council members more for less.
- More important even than clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the special counsel. If it's half the cost and you're doing twice the work, people start to look at that special counsel role with a different perspective. If we could change the perspective, that would be huge.
- SSP: I look at the special counsel as the board for regulatory reasons. Would it make sense for a treasury working group to manage our treasury? Absolutely. This is not a case about creating roles. It's about creating opportunities and lanes for other people in the community.
- SSP: In terms of the special counsel role, it really, in my eyes, should be, as we mentioned, diverse. We should be looking know what have been the greatest value creators in our past century. We'll have the conversation with special counsel on Wednesday.
- Machi: Do you think that the metric that we should be tracking is the amount of apecoin or the value of that that is in our treasury? Would love to hear your thoughts on that. If we had to buckle down for one year, hold the treasury strong, earn some kind of yield on it.
- The metric to track within the Dow is actually the value created in the Dow. Why are the startups the one that create the most value? It's because the metric the vcs are tracking is the amount of value created. It makes sense for ape to think of itself in that startup mindset.
- Right now in the bear market or the beginning of a bull, or where we are today, I don't want to see powered by apecoin proposals. Now I want to seeing value back. That's where my vote would go.
- So please, when you guys are writing your AIP, do consider, and I have seen people recently, like a $2 million ask. I think quarter million, comfortable. Anything higher? Half million. Small checks, easier pass, easier for us to vote yes.
- Startups is not necessarily the best metric to look at. The Dow in general, we have to be really mindful about the regulatory environment that we play in. We do have startup infrastructure that we can be building and funding eT. Let's see what happens.
- The thank a proposal is in the idea stage. We're asking for to do something truly meaningful to go make huge impact. If you got feedback, insight, information, now's the time. We want to get feedback from people.
- My biggest concern going into special counsel and if I do get elected in is something that I have to tackle head on. What do we really want to see as those KPIs? And somehow we got to be on the same page.
- There's less than 1% participation across our 141,000 unique wallet. Participation, alignment of authors, passing of aips, overall value and sustainability. What does sustainability look like?
- For me, the only KPI that really matters is what is the price of apecoin in a year's time after your term as special counselor. And Machi, thanks for your perspective there on the role you describing.
- 40% of approved aips are still being negotiated during the grant agreement negotiation process. Even now, I feel like it's not as fast as it could be if you automated the process more. I think that would increase efficiency, effectiveness just by adopting nouns things.
- "Are we really involving legal in every single AIP? Because that's a lot of money " In real life, the legal agreements would be much earlier in the process. A quick win over here is to review this legal agreement at phase six, at admin review.
- SSP ghosted is know for special counsel. Why did SSP shift and go into as special counsel? Other than for the comedic value, I want to see Machi going at SSP and that could be something we can all enjoy.
- My question is aa adventures ape mentioned. Howie test my ears peaked. And I want to know how real is this danger and do we need to separate the special counsel? How real is that danger? And can someone speak to that?
- The regulatory environment is just very, I don't know even know how to phrase it. There's just no real right and wrong way to do things. The line is gray. You just have to be real careful that you're aware of everything that's going on.
- I think any grant agreement going forward will be a lot easier after mine goes through. They know the Dow as a community will push back. You should be graduatory, not adversarial, and figure a way out to make this easy for us. Future is bright.
- Fenwick is known as also the less conservative. They really want to support what we're doing around the. apecoin Dow. I think the board needs to be separate. It's just stewarding, overseeing the ape foundation and then just being a safety layer for aips.
- SSP: The responsibilities as they're currently written, don't reflect true board responsibilities. He says if the intent is to get special counsel to truly a board, we've also got to start fundamentally at rewriting what those responsibilities are. SSP: Who in the community will take up some of these other executive kind of roles for the community?
- Bradley: Does the SC role give us a problem from a compliance perspective at this present moment in time? Do we want a real board advisory board making sure that they're taking care of things with the Cayman Islands foundation and a safety net for AIPS sSp? I'm happy to have this conversation and debate.
- There's a conflation between what it is to be a dow and what stage we're in right now. What I'm suggesting is, yes, we need to think about what is this going to look like long term. Short term benefit is we remove a whole bunch of questions.
- All the special council members that are trying to run right now throw up an AIP. We want to see how creative you could be, how well you can write and see how good your ideas are. If you've never written an Aip and you're ready for special counsel, vote them down.
- All of you that are running for special counsel, write an AIP. Show us what you got. If I got to fly back to Taiwan to get another proposal approved, I'm doing it. One of the things that we are working on is trying to automate the system.
- Tiger: One of the struggles we do have with the current stewards is we are not devs. These new working group have a little bit more freedom because we are community members. We represent the community and the DAO to implement some cool ideas that you guys may have.
- Uzi: It's important to know the environment that we operate in. If we get labeled as security, that's going to be a whole mess of things we don't do anything about. I'm totally for pushing the dow forward and things that we can do. But I also think we need to be careful not to go too far.
- Apecoin hasn't been labeled as security. The thing that they look at is the Howie test. That's an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others. Every token is a security depends.
- Using pre approved proposals and collateralized proposals so that someone can request a proposal in advance and before they actually go through and build something. This could increase the amount of proposals the DAO can fulfill without increasing the risk to the whole.
- I am an advisor to Salana Metaplex everywhere. There's a difference. Machi said, write an AIP if you're a special council member. Let them hit you with the no vote or a yes vote depending on the value of your AIP. Legal counsel should not change the terms of the AIP after it has been voted on.
- Who negotiates the grant agreement on behalf of the Ape foundation? I think it is the ape foundation. Once you get your AIP passed, the Dow wants it passed and the special counsel has got to help the AIP authors get their legal agreements. That is hopefully getting straightened out.
- There's currently 95 AIP, 94 aips in process throughout the ideation and the approved implementation stage. To me, the Dow space is about how are we going to govern ourselves in the next 300 years. And I get really excited in finding and empowering the other people that want to keep building.
- "What we have here is the facts of the role currently, " he says. "If you put a proposal up, it could change this " If you get the other four members on board with your ideas, you could change the scope here.
- Special counsel sometimes might assist in the grant agreement process. When they step in during that process, it might come across as scope creep. How are we addressing problems like that going forward?
- SSP: Please stop trying to make scope creep happen. Do you walk off into the sunset if this passes? He says he's been on the board for 525 plus days. SSP: We have to think about the whole picture at once.
- There are unintended consequences to pretty much all large aips, especially foundational. I want to empower and open up lanes for the entire community to come through with their ideas. Why not put out a call to have ideas before you open them up?
- The job description and the website with regards to the roles and responsibilities for SC are contradictory. It does say, though they are not limited to the items listed below. So I see this as very much the capabilities that you need to have as an SC candidate.
- SSP: The role for the ape foundation needs to be a highly experienced individual that has the experience of building and navigating a complex business. Does that in any way put us in jeopardy? And do we need to spend 200k on legal to protect us?
- When I initially wrote AIP 351, it was also going to be a budget for legal bills to set both those groups up as Dow LLCs in the Marshall Islands. Now, this is not financial advice. This is not legal advice. How cool would it be if we went back to this?
- All right. Big bull, I keep trying to get you up here. Maybe you have an Android device like SSP. A third time's a charm. Let's hear from big bull if we can, and then we'll wrap it up.
- SSP. Impromptu discussion about the apecoin board. The apecoin special council token. There's a lot of ifs and questions. And of course, I'm going for the governance steward role.
- And with the apecoin token, there was a great space about using ac and AC or ape. There are only three proposals live this week. You got till Wednesday, 06:00 p. m. PST to get your votes in for these.
- And I presume maybe some of the other people in the audience did not understand what you said about having the prospect of setting up an LLC first. Really eye opening and really great conversation. So many great things here today. Thanks, man.
- Well, you guys approved Dave coms, and we got to take advantage of our time here. We had the opportunity to cut it off for him at an hour, but I looked at SSP and he went, he wants to run for special counsel. We're going to make him do markoms anyway.
- Paul: Will there be some other areas of responsibilities? More than likely, yes. But does it mean it's just going to be the working groups? Not necessarily. We're expecting the community to do it, which is the whole goal of decentralized autonomous organizations.
- Concluding thoughts, summarizing statements, how you feel about everything other than done today. Got our proposal approved? AIP 348. We're scrappy. Make it happen. Monday, Wednesday and Friday we do these stages. More information to come.
