- Total global debt is now three times total global GDP. Can a debt load three times global GDP ever be sustainable? Is there any responsible way to reduce this debt? And what could go wrong if we can't?
- Government spending will naturally need to be put towards projects that are purely humanitarian interest, but most are not. If governments take on debt to endlessly fund projects that don't produce a positive economic return, then they will eventually go broke. The composition of GDP is arguably even more important for households and businesses.
