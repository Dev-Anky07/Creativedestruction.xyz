- We just launched the Arbitram Nitro DevNet and full code base. And also announced our plans to deploy it on mainnet and migrate Arbitram One to Nitro. This is a really big step for us ultimately to scale way past where we are today.
- Arbortrum Nitro lets you run arbitrary programs on top of the Geth chain. Uses WebAssembly Virtual Machine which is a standard execution environment used all over the web. Uses less code and more performance by compiling it into WASM and running the chain with that.
- In Nitro, we have fully integrated broadly compression. Every transaction that you submit through the Arbitrage sequencer is getting broadly compressed. It saves around a factor of two in the size of your transactions. That is one of the things that drives lower cost and will drive lower fees once we transition mainnet over to Nitro.
- Harry: What's exciting is what's currently live on Arbitram One is very Ethereum and EVM compatible. One of the things we've learned from being live is those slight divergences are big pain points for developers. Some of the most interesting and maybe most counterintuitive aspects tonight's show have to do with some of the performance gains.
- On Arbitram One, code gets compiled down into AVM code. On Nitro we can run go code directly. One of the kind of most interesting kind of performance improvements that we get from Nitro.
- What were the biggest challenges in terms of getting to Nitro? Either like conceptual research questions or even just implementations surprises. Was it all just smooth sailing for everyone?
- The other thing I would throw in there is like, proving over WASM. And there are a bunch of clever tricks in the way that we do that. There's just a number of other nice optimizations and improvements kind of around the edges that will make life nicer and easier.
- With Nitro we will just have tracing out of the box. Everything that happens, everything that happens in Nitro is traceable because of that. For anybody who wants some real technical alpha, there's a lot of cool stuff in the Nitro repo.
- Well, I think maybe you can take just a few questions from people in the crowd. If you want to speak, just raise your hand. Questions about Nitro, though. Stephen, what's your favorite food?
- Fraud proof protocol is implemented in Solidity. Just like Arbitram today, we're fully virtualizing. These are code paths that will in all likelihood not run really ever in production. But you need to make sure they don't have bugs.
- Ed: How will the hash Oracle trick help potentially with the performance of Nitro or just even relate to it? In normal execution, you're just doing Geth things, just using the database in a native way. Only if there is a dispute and somebody has to prove what happens within one block.
- Sapnog: Fair sequencing is something that is in the future, still on the roadmap. Nitro is a big upgrade for Arbitram. Are there any platforms that are going to be spinning up DevNet, like apps for Nitro right away? Can't wait for smartcon.
- Daniel Alder: We're doing less layers of virtualization with Arbitram. The big innovation is basically the way smart contracts run. Anything you can do to speed things up locally as long as you're keeping determinism is viable. It was a clear choice to go to the second.
- You can permissionly bridge any token from layer one into Arbitrum. We actually already support every token on ethereum. Maybe it looks like Albie is still connecting. Let's bring up another.
- Angelfish: I'm curious if you guys have thought about ways to leverage this technology in the future. Can we take this and compile some other stack or other VM to this? Right now, that's definitely not what we're working on. But the flexibility in execution environment is one of those really cool long term things.
- Thanks, everyone, for coming and listening today. Check out Nitro and let us know what you think. If you're a developer, front end, back end, you name it, please apply to join our team.
