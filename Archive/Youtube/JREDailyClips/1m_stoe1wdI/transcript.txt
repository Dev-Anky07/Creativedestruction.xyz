[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker A : And Blassie had two sets of false teeth. One he'd eat with, and another pair he'd file down on TV. Then he would bite the wrestlers in the head in Japan. Suck the blood on their head, then spit it back in their face. No, I'm serious, bro. I'm serious. And on TV, Asai. On TV, Asai. The first weekend Blassie wrestled on TV, three old ladies passed out and died. Oh, my God. This is a Fred Blassie story.
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:26.000 ] Speaker B : Tell you on this? That is insane.
[ 0:00:26.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : So this is blassy telling me this stuff. So now I've got Matsuda, and I'm going over there. Blassy and Ricky dozen was the Mafia guy, and he got killed by a Mafia guy over in Japan. But now I got this backstory of Matsuda and Blassy. That's why I stayed over there 22, 24 weeks out of the year. It was like, I loved it over there.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:48.000 ] Speaker B : That's amazing.
[ 0:00:48.000 ---> 0:00:59.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it was great. And they don't call me Hulk Hogan there. They call me Itchy Bond there. Yeah. So whenever you see me with those black and silver tights, that's the itchy Bond number one logo on my.
[ 0:01:01.000 ---> 0:01:19.000 ] Speaker B : A. That's incredible. So what a great place to experience the different styles of pro wrestling, too, right? Because, like, American style pro wrestling versus Japanese style. And then there's, like, Mexican styles. A different style as well, right?
[ 0:01:19.000 ---> 0:01:19.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:01:20.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker B : How many different styles of pro wrestling are there? It's bigger in America and bigger in Japan than anywhere else, right?
[ 0:01:28.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker A : Well, Lucha labor is a different thing. Because when you see anybody in America, boom, they take your arm, they take your left arm. They always work off the left side. Everything you do, Mexico, they work off the right side. Okay. My first time I was in Mexico City, I was in that big arena that has the hole in the roof. Mexico City, the big building.
[ 0:01:49.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:01:49.000 ---> 0:02:31.000 ] Speaker A : And I'm in a six man tag. They put me in six man tag. For some reason, I don't do tag matches. I got two Mexican partners who don't speak English. And there's three other Mexican guys who don't speak English. They don't even tag over there. Usually have to wait to get the tag. They're just running out of the ring with NO tag. It took me, like, ten minutes to figure out that you didn't need to tag. Nobody told me, so. It was just crazy. But the stuff they do is just, like, whole nother level. The Eddie Guerreros and Chavo Guerreros and all these guys, man, they're in Ray Mysterio these guys are just supermen, wild acrobatics. And they can wrestle, too. I mean, Chavo is the man. His whole family, they're legends.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:45.000 ] Speaker B : So in the 70s, when you were first getting going, how many different organizations were there? Were there, like, small, local places? And then there's one big one that was on television. How many different organizations were there back then?
[ 0:02:45.000 ---> 0:02:52.000 ] Speaker A : Like, when I grew up, I saw Florida Championship wrestling, and that's the only thing I saw.
[ 0:02:53.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker B : So that was like a local.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it was just a local promotion.
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:02:57.000 ] Speaker B : Was it cable back then?
[ 0:02:57.000 ---> 0:07:43.000 ] Speaker A : No, regular local TV. And we didn't get Channel 17, Ted Turner's cable at the time. I didn't know that there was Madison Square Garden, New York territory. That is New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. And then there was, like, Minnesota, Verne Gynes territory. Then there's Fritzvah and Eric Dallas. Bill Watts had Louisiana, Michael LaBelle had LA. So there were all these little teeny territories, and all the promoters respected each other. So if Joe Rogan had Texas, I would never come in to Dallas and try to run a show. In your area, there are these imaginary boundaries that you don't cross your spec. That was Vince McMahon senior, and he was loyal to all these promoters. And every once in a while, he'd send, like, superstar Billy Graham down to Florida to wrestle, or ox Baker from New York down to wrestle, and we'd see these guys come in, and I didn't know where they came from, but they'd come in and the local hero, like Dusty Rhodes, would beat them up and they'd be gone. So I had no idea how the whole system worked. And all I saw was Florida Championship wrestling. So after I got in and I figured out all these know, like, I went to Minnesota and wrestled, and I went to North Florida, the Fuller terrItory, which is P Cola, and all through Mobile, Alabama, and Birmingham, that small territory, I went to Memphis and worked for Lawler and Jerry Jarrett for a while, but then when I went to work for Vince Jr. And I went back after being fired and having my first run in New York, when I went back in 84 to beat the Iron Chic, Vince wanted to cross all those imaginary boundaries. And I'm going, wow, this is going to be dangerous. So Vince says, are you up for it? I said, yeah, I'll do it. And so Vince stayed in Connecticut, in Greenwich, in the office, and then I was booked in Lafayette, Louisiana. We pump our signal in there for like, eight know, prime examples. Kansas City. I don't know if you ever heard of a wrestler named Harley Race. Yeah, sure. NWA champion. Tougher than hell, meaner than a snake. Great guy, though. Okay. We pumped the signal into Kansas City for eight weeks. And Harley Race has been there, like, 18 years. He was the NWA champion. I'm the champion of the world. And he's a very proud and mean son of a bitch. And all of a sudden, here comes this blonde haired idiot from New York going, hey, I'm the WWF champion. I'm the WWE champion. I'm coming to Kemper arena, and we're pumped. The signal. So I come, I fly into town. I show up about two in the afternoon. My guys call me. Harley Race came down here with a gun. He tried to light the ring on fire. Whoa. And had. The cops ran him up and they didn't arrest him. Oh, shit. And they told me, Harley said, when I show up, he's going to kill you. So I go across the street and I go to the rusty scupper, this bar, right? And I was notorious at the time for not kind of like being on time because the matches would start, like at 730 to 08:00 and they wanted you to building at 630. I'd come rolling at about 930 after intermission. And I'd have time to put my boots on because I don't want to talk about wrestling. I just want to go do it. It's like playing guitar or anything. It's like chess. You think two, three moves ahead. And so now I don't need to be at the building early, and I damn sure don't want to run at Harley Race. This guy's going to kill me. I'm scared to death of him. Anyway. I've known him since I was a know. So now I'm across a rusty scupper, drinking bottles of wine. Drinking bottles of wine. But anyway, like, going down to Puerto Rico. First time we go down to Puerto Rico. I'd never been to Puerto Rico before. All the boys tell me how violent it is. They cut you, they burn you with cigarettes. They throw everything at you in Puerto Rico. So I'd never been. I didn't need to go. But now Vince wants to go down to Puerto Rico and Carlos Cologne had the territory there for like 30 or 40 years. So here we come. And I go rolling down to Puerto Rico with Cindy Lopper with me, right? So I go down to Puerto Rico and we have the match and we sell the stadium. Me and Macho man go back to the room and we go walk in his room. His room is trashed. His room is trashed. And so all of a sudden, I go, oh, my God, let me go to my room. So all of a sudden, I go to my room, and I don't want to say the guy's name, but when I open the door, he's sitting there, because he's still really active, and he's sitting there with the gun. He said, if you ever come back here, you're going to kill. So, okay. I was going back to Tampa. I hauled ass to the airport. I got on an Eastern Airlines flight, the last one out of town, and flew to LA. I was supposed to be going home to Tampa. About four months later, Bruce of Brody goes down there, has a little argument. The booker calls him into the shower, cuts his throat and kills him.
[ 0:07:43.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker B : Jesus.
[ 0:07:44.000 ---> 0:07:45.000 ] Speaker A : So that's down there in Puerto Rico.
