We're running a job hunting bootcamp and we're going to cover the basics of crafting a really great resume, learning how to tell your story and how to reach out effectively to get actual responses. Now, these tips are not just for working at startups, but for all companies. And YC's Jobs platform has helped thousands of people get jobs, from tiny startups to the likes of Instacart, Art, Twitch and DoorDash. So sign up below. We have limited spots because we really want to make this bespoke and personal to the individual participants and help them find their next roles. Looking forward to meeting you. All right, see you soon.
