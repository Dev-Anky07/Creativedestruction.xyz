- Emmett Shearer is the CEO of Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon. He will talk about how to do great user interviews. This is the talking to users part of starting a startup.
- Take 120 seconds right now and think about not what you would ask or what the right features for this app is. Who would you talk to, who is going to give you that feedback that's going to tell you whether this is good or not? Figure out where to source the people.
- Stephanie: I would definitely talk to college students first, obviously, because we fit in a lot of lectures. One of the problems with selling things to students is that they don't actually spend very much money. But there are other groups that are potential that could be critical to app success.
- Stephanie: How do you take notes today? She uses Google Docs and Evernote. Do you review your notes at the end of the semester? Once the quarter is over, do you ever go back to any of that stuff?
- You want to stay as far away from features as possible because the things they tell you wind up almost feeling overwhelmingly real. As you start to talk to lots of people and really get a sense for what their problems are, you figure out if this is actually a promising area.
- Don't go out and say, come up with a feature idea and ask people. The one question you can't ask is, is this feature actually good or not? What is the minimum that you can do in your experience to get real data on that question between asking and actually building the whole thing?
- When we were working on Twitch to go launch it, we talked to a bunch of existing Justin TV broadcasters. This is where they felt pain using the product. And so if you thought that what we did was go and address these problems, you would be wrong. It kind of means that these are probably not actually the biggest problems.
- We got competitor broadcaster feedback, which is really interesting. They talked about a lot about video stability. Our service wasn't good in Europe specifically, but just globally. Most of them actually had thought about it because our user base happened to be a very well educated user base.
- The majority of people you're competing with are non users. What they say is the thing that blocks you from expanding the size of the market with your features. Once our strategy gets broadcast in a major tournament, we have to come up with an entirely new strategy.
- Most common mistakes are showing people your product, don't show them your product. Talking to who's available rather than talking to who they need to talk to. Recording interviews is like magic. How do you get buy in from the rest of your company?
- You don't want to do interviews over email if you can avoid it. The most interesting things you learn in interviews come from the interesting. Make sure you ask them if it's okay to record it. It's not polite to record people without their consent.
-  twitch works better in English speaking countries than it does in non-English speaking countries. Trying to do user interviews with people who don't speak your language is hard. Companies find it easier to build markets that win in their home country much more easily than abroad.
- The channels we used to reach out to them were on site messaging systems. We tended not to compensate people. If people don't care enough about the problem to talk to someone who's trying to solve it, you're probably barking up the wrong tree.
- What about user feedback tools? So there's this whole second set of user feedback that's really important. It's much more similar though, to the data driven approach. For this kind of like really early stage user interview, that's where you want to focus.
-  Twitch originally spoke to broadcasters and streamers themselves. As Twitch has gotten bigger, game publishers have become an increasingly important constituency. The pool of people you care about is going to shift over time. The people who get you started are not who will be using it three years later.
- How do you give good user feedback if you're a user? I want a user to tell me about what they're really thinking, and what their problems really are. If you want to help people out with good user interview feedback, ramble.
