- The Beacon is a rogue light action RPG. Basically means you just slash through dungeons really fast and get loot. Will be adding social elements at some point where you can join like a town MMO style with other players.
- House saves across all your characters, which is nice. Once you've completed the tavern quiz in the dungeon for the day, you'll see it's checked off. Let's go try the dungeon on this character, but let's try to clean it up a bit.
- One of the new features in the game is item recycling. You can take ten items of one rarity and recycle it to get one item of a higher rarity. If you do rares, you get raffle tickets and an Epic chest. Here's how to make your room feel like a dungeon.
- All right, Arbonates, thanks for joining me on episode one of Speedrunners. I was playing the beacon on Arbitram One. Whatever games you want to see next, just leave comments below.
