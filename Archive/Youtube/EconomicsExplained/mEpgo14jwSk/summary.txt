- Since industrialization, modern, consumer focused economies have followed the business cycle. These booms and busts tend to have a frequency of about seven to ten years. Most economists will also point out that these cycles tend to trend upwards as economies grow over time.
- Is this boom and bust pattern of modern economics a bug caused by human nature? Or is it a feature of the systems that we have built that provide us with some kind of benefit? In the long term, you really need to increase both of these factors together to achieve stable economic prosperity.
- There are two broad classifications of economic downturns. Demand and supply downturns are the ones that we are most familiar with. Increasing demand is as simple as putting more money in more people's pockets. Countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy has been used for decades now to smooth out the cycle.
- Economic downturns caused by both demand and supply side issues play a crucial role in sustaining long term growth. They act as a filter to weed out poor economic practices that are only surviving thanks to good economic times. Most economists are extremely hesitant to talk about any benefit to economic downturns.
