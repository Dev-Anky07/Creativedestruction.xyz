- Tanay Tanden is the CEO and founder of Athelis, a digital health company. YC first met Tanay when he was 17 years old, when he first won YC's first hackathon. Now Athelis benefits hundreds of thousands of patients across the nation. The company is worth more than billion.
- Ethelus builds remote patient monitoring and revenue cycle management tools for healthcare systems and healthcare practices. Started primarily when we went through YC. Was primarily a diagnostics company. Still one of the larger revenue lines in the business.
- What gave you the confidence at 1719 to jump out there and start a company? Things like YC exist now, and these things didn't exist or exist in biotech 1015 years ago. The concept that you can actually iterate your way to get good at something is fairly new.
- I was a research intern at the Stanford AI lab. My co founder, Deepika, one of my best friends since high school. The idea was like, if we can get high resolution enough images of a small volume of blood, we could probably do this for any type of blood cell. And as a result, you could generate a CBC very quickly.
- It really started as a research project, and then once we noticed it was working, we realized it was important to build a business here and actually turn this into a product. How did your family or other people around you respond to you wanting to drop out of school?
- Growing up in the Bay Area, YC was sort of ever present. The first version of Athalis was actually built at YC hacks. And then we applied once and it was too early. Then we applied the second time and we got in and then we did YCE.
- Deepka: Before even starting YC, we said, we are going to finish a clinical trial. The trial itself came together during the batch. Using that as our North Star just forced a level of speed and execution that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
- So were you also interacting with the FDA or doing anything on the regulatory end? At this point, I think we had one or two pieces of communication just trying to honestly just understand and clarify the requirements for our device. As a startup, you're a heat seeking missile for a very specific goal in a very, very fast timeline.
- I think pre subs are a waste of time. The feedback they give you isn't binding. So the 510K thing is faster. I prefer it just going straight for the kill. In 2018, we finally got the clearance.
- The initial device is a segment, right? It's a part of our revenue after clearance. If we want to build a business that is doing hundreds of millions or billions in run rate, we need to expand what we offer. And that's really how I wouldn't even call it a pivot necessarily.
- At the time that you wanted to expand, how did your existing investors react? What was that conversation like with them? I think our approach was, look, we have delivered on the initial. You earn the right to build more as you deliver customer happiness.
- A lot of early stage entrepreneurs wonder how they're going to grow their initial team or find the right people to get the company off the ground. Find people that will work really hard to learn the underlying thing and haven't had to coast at any point. Fast shipping cadence makes all the difference.
- Athalis wants to end the year at a 50 million run rate. In total, we're 300 people, 150 in India, 120 ish here, and then we have 30 that are kind of remote spread around the world today. Our product is essential to the clinics and healthcare providers that we work with.
- So today in the audience, we have a lot of entrepreneurs a couple of years into their journey. Any advice for budding entrepreneurs? "Be ready for ten years of pain, but with pieces of fun and just really exciting moments that make it all worth it"
