[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker A : Well, we have, what is it, 6 million pigs in the United States now?
[ 0:00:03.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker B : They.
[ 0:00:03.000 ---> 0:00:05.000 ] Speaker A : They came from eleven.
[ 0:00:06.000 ---> 0:00:07.000 ] Speaker C : Is that real?
[ 0:00:07.000 ---> 0:00:07.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:00:07.000 ---> 0:00:14.000 ] Speaker A : Wow. Eleven pigs that were dropped off in the Florida. In the, I think mainland Florida, maybe the keys. But eleven pigs is what they believe.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker C : And that was by the Spaniards, right?
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:17.000 ] Speaker B : Correct. Yeah. Yeah.
[ 0:00:17.000 ---> 0:00:18.000 ] Speaker C : Nuts.
[ 0:00:18.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker A : Isn't that crazy?
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:28.000 ] Speaker C : I mean, that's crazy. But maybe it's even crazier the fact they brought smallpox as well and killed 90% of the Native Americans. Yeah, that's nuts.
[ 0:00:28.000 ---> 0:00:29.000 ] Speaker A : That's a little worse.
[ 0:00:29.000 ---> 0:00:29.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:00:29.000 ---> 0:00:36.000 ] Speaker C : When you tell people that, because so many people, most people are aware there was a genocide of Native Americans.
[ 0:00:36.000 ---> 0:00:36.000 ] Speaker B : Sure.
[ 0:00:36.000 ---> 0:00:39.000 ] Speaker C : But most people are not aware that most of it was due to disease.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:00:40.000 ---> 0:00:44.000 ] Speaker C : When I had explained that to someone, that it was 90% of the people were killed by smallpox, they're like, what?
[ 0:00:44.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : And it was purposely introduced disease, correct?
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker C : I don't believe so.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, it just came with people?
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:00:50.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, it just came with people.
[ 0:00:50.000 ---> 0:00:51.000 ] Speaker A : Interesting.
[ 0:00:51.000 ---> 0:01:00.000 ] Speaker C : I don't think they really understood how to introduce diseases back then. Like the idea that they thought that you could have it on a blanket. Yeah, I don't think that's true.
[ 0:01:00.000 ---> 0:01:01.000 ] Speaker B : Interesting.
[ 0:01:01.000 ---> 0:01:20.000 ] Speaker C : Let's find that out. I believe that myth has been busted, but they know now that that's what killed off the Mayans, because there was always this big mystery, like, where'd the Mayans, where did these people, they had this incredible civilization so complex, mimic the cosmos and their architecture? There's no evidence that the scheme worked.
[ 0:01:21.000 ---> 0:01:22.000 ] Speaker A : This is regarding the blanket.
[ 0:01:22.000 ---> 0:01:43.000 ] Speaker C : Infection of the blankets was apparently old, so no one could catch smallpox from the blankets. Besides, the Indians just had smallpox. Smallpox had reached Fort Pit and had come from Indians. And anyone susceptible to smallpox had already had. Just think. I think it was just a thing that people had, and they brought it over and then it killed everybody. It also killed everybody in the Amazon.
[ 0:01:43.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker A : And people here in the Americas had no tolerance to it.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:53.000 ] Speaker A : Because they hadn't evolved alongside the disease, which had evolved over thousands of years, millions of years.
[ 0:01:53.000 ---> 0:01:54.000 ] Speaker C : They had no natural immunity to it.
[ 0:01:54.000 ---> 0:01:54.000 ] Speaker A : Right.
[ 0:01:55.000 ---> 0:02:01.000 ] Speaker C : And then that's also what they believe was responsible for decimating the Amazon. Like, they think the Amazon had millions.
[ 0:02:01.000 ---> 0:02:04.000 ] Speaker A : Of people, the Incans and the Mayans and all those things.
[ 0:02:04.000 ---> 0:02:05.000 ] Speaker B : Just all those people.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:07.000 ] Speaker A : I didn't realize that. That's really interesting.
[ 0:02:07.000 ---> 0:02:17.000 ] Speaker C : The really wild stuff that's being done in the Amazon is Lidar. Oh, I know where they're finding all this evidence of these ancient structures that were just overcome by the jungle.
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:02:31.000 ] Speaker A : Have you seen the Honduran lost City of the Monkey. There's a legit, full civilization in Honduras. Like a bustling city that they found in Lidar two or three years ago. Using LidaR two or three years.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:32.000 ] Speaker B : Empty.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker A : Empty.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker C : Empty.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:39.000 ] Speaker A : But like a full scale city, not like a village or a town, like tens of thousands.
[ 0:02:39.000 ---> 0:02:39.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:02:39.000 ---> 0:02:40.000 ] Speaker A : Look at that.
[ 0:02:40.000 ---> 0:02:57.000 ] Speaker C : Fucking wild. Yeah, but it totally makes sense, man. If you bring in smallpox, I mean, smallpox kills like 90% of the people that get it, right? So it just fucking decimated the populations of these places where these European settlers made through. That's the whole story behind the lost city of Z.
[ 0:02:58.000 ---> 0:03:08.000 ] Speaker A : Well, I knew that the city went away and Percy went to look for it with his son and his son's friend, blah, blah, blah. But I didn't realize that the idea that smallpox had wiped it out was the reason behind it.
[ 0:03:08.000 ---> 0:03:25.000 ] Speaker C : Well, theory behind it is. And all sorts of diseases, not just smallpox, but that when the Europeans first came through, when they first reported about these immense cities, they were there. Yeah, they were there. And so then when people came back, like 100 years later, they're like, this is bullshit. Because the jungle would just overcome everything.
[ 0:03:25.000 ---> 0:03:26.000 ] Speaker A : And it can in so little time.
[ 0:03:26.000 ---> 0:03:27.000 ] Speaker C : So little time.
[ 0:03:27.000 ---> 0:03:28.000 ] Speaker B : It's crazy.
[ 0:03:28.000 ---> 0:03:31.000 ] Speaker A : The rate of growth when the jungle is left alone is unbelievable.
[ 0:03:31.000 ---> 0:03:36.000 ] Speaker C : And then there's the weirdness that the jungle itself is actually man made.
[ 0:03:36.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker A : Whoa, hold on.
[ 0:03:37.000 ---> 0:03:38.000 ] Speaker B : I don't know about this.
[ 0:03:38.000 ---> 0:03:38.000 ] Speaker C : You didn't know that?
[ 0:03:38.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker A : No. Tell me.
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:04:36.000 ] Speaker C : Yes, most of the plants that are overwhelming the rainforest are from agriculture, from ancient civilizations. Yeah, I think it's like the ice cream bean tree and a bunch of other different trees. But these trees were all trees that had been grown. Yes, it is actually man made. One of thousands of earthworks built by remarkable but little known ancient societies. The Amazon, prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas in 1492, is commonly depicted as a pristine wilderness dotted with small, simple communities. Wow. The Amazon rainforest created. Yeah, click on that one. This supposedly pristine, untouched Amazon rainforest was actually shaped by humans over thousands of years. Native people played a strong role in molding the ecology of this vast wilderness. So these trees that overwhelm the rainforest, they were planted, they're cultivated.
[ 0:04:36.000 ---> 0:04:36.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:04:36.000 ---> 0:04:39.000 ] Speaker C : And then they just run amok.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:04:40.000 ] Speaker A : Interesting.
[ 0:04:40.000 ---> 0:04:56.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, they're just really fertile. And the ground, they had developed this type. Was it called terra Prada? Is that what it's called? They had developed a very specific type of soil that they actually. It's a soil.
[ 0:04:56.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker A : I know about this, and we've been unable to replicate it exactly. Yes, I do know a bit about, but I guess the difference being those were all native plants.
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker B : Right?
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker A : So while the Amazon may have been cultivated by different tribes in the Amazon, they're not getting those plants or trees from anywhere but the immediate surrounding area.
[ 0:05:18.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker B : Right?
[ 0:05:18.000 ---> 0:05:22.000 ] Speaker A : I mean, maybe not immediate, but within the South Americas, I'm not exactly sure.
[ 0:05:22.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker A : It's not like they're importing olives from Spain, right? They're using the resources.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:28.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:31.000 ] Speaker C : I don't think they're saying they're invasive. I'm just thinking they're cultivated.
[ 0:05:31.000 ---> 0:05:48.000 ] Speaker A : But that's fascinating because it's amazing. You certainly don't think of that. And you don't think of, at least in today's world, I don't think of the Amazon as being populous. I mean, I'm not talking about Manaus and cities, I'm talking about the wild Amazon. You don't think of civilizations being able to impact that much vastness.
[ 0:05:48.000 ---> 0:05:50.000 ] Speaker C : Graham Hancock thinks there was 20 million people living in it.
[ 0:05:50.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker A : 20 million?
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:52.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:05:52.000 ---> 0:05:53.000 ] Speaker A : Wow. That's unbelievable.
[ 0:05:53.000 ---> 0:06:13.000 ] Speaker C : He thinks it was a vast society. It was filled with human beings and structures, and this is all being like, they have only used lidar in a very small percentage of the empire, of course. And they're showing all sorts of structures, irrigation systems and grids that indicate cities and blocks. It's wild stuff, man.
[ 0:06:14.000 ---> 0:06:54.000 ] Speaker A : I mean, it sort of makes sense in the sense of the abundance of resources down there, right? It's easy to grow a population when you have so much natural resources. Everything that you plant grows. There's another side of that argument that I've heard paleontologists make, where when things are too easy, people don't evolve, right? That's a different side of that coin. But if you think about it from like a logical standpoint of when things are easy, it's easy to increase your population. And when you're not fighting for survival every day because there's coconuts and palm trees and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, it's easy to reproduce and have more kids and grow a society versus when you're spending half of your life just trying to get by.
[ 0:06:54.000 ---> 0:07:17.000 ] Speaker C : That's an interesting argument, that when things are easy, that people don't grow or evolve. That seems weird to me because it would seem to me that once your resources were taken care of, once you have food and shelter, you have more time to think. So you have more time to make life convenient, more time to sell goods that would be valuable to people, more time to improve and innovate on those goods.
[ 0:07:17.000 ---> 0:07:51.000 ] Speaker A : But the argument is when things are too easy, you don't push the status quo. So because there are so many abundant resources, you have no need to develop tools and technologies that advance society. So the argument, I don't remember the scientists that said this. It's basically, if you look along the band of the equator at this time, and this is an older publication, I believe those were the least developed societies in the world. As you get further away from the know, up into the Arctic, not the Arctic, but like up into Scandinavia and so on and so forth, you get more and more advanced civilizations.
