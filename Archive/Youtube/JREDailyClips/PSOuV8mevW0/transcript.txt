[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker A : And if I'm moving bees from point A to point B, and I don't know where the queen is typically, where most of the bees congregate. Oh, my gosh.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker B : Here's a video.
[ 0:00:13.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : Wow. I never watched these again.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:20.000 ] Speaker B : And so that's like a little clip that you use. That's the queen in there. You've found the queen.
[ 0:00:21.000 ---> 0:01:10.000 ] Speaker A : I tell you what, that moment feels so good, it's hard to capture it in video. Oh, that's a bee telling the other bees where to go. She's fanning her Nazanov gland. So you can actually see the Nazanov gland in that video in that little clip. So on the back of her abdomen. Wow. Thank you, Jamie. On the. Yeah, the back of her abdomen, you can kind of see it. So see how she has all those little black stripes, and then at the end you can. Yeah. It's a little gland that's exposed, and that's one of the pheromones, the ways they communicate. And she is signaling to all the other bees where to go, and she's letting them know you can see them start to move down and into the new hive. It was getting dark. I was racing daylight there. And then they will eventually do the rest of the work for you.
[ 0:01:10.000 ---> 0:01:15.000 ] Speaker B : You're doing this with no beekeeper suit, nothing on your hands, nothing.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:19.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. This was a really great colony of bees.
[ 0:01:20.000 ---> 0:01:22.000 ] Speaker B : Are there bad colonies of bees?
[ 0:01:22.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker A : There are certainly bees that can be more defensive.
[ 0:01:26.000 ---> 0:01:27.000 ] Speaker B : But why would that be?
[ 0:01:27.000 ---> 0:02:12.000 ] Speaker A : Well, if they don't have all the resources they need, if they're in a bad spot, if they don't have a queen. A large colony tends to be more defensive than a smaller one because they have more resources to defend. So sometimes you'll see me do this, and it's a small swarm, so it's a swarm where there's no comb, there's no beeswax, there's no nectar, pollen, or honey, there's no baby bees, so they don't have anything to defend. And they're much gentler in those cases, most of the time. But every colony is different. Every colony has a different behavior and is in a different set of circumstances. So I never know what I'm getting myself into.
[ 0:02:12.000 ---> 0:02:16.000 ] Speaker B : So what would cause them to be there if they didn't have those resources?
[ 0:02:16.000 ---> 0:03:30.000 ] Speaker A : To be whEre? Like, in the wall right there. Those bees had been there for a number of years. I don't know exactly how long, but those bees likely were relocating, looking for a new place to live because maybe their hive, something happened to it. It got damaged, maybe they felt like they didn't have the resources they needed around their hive and they wanted to move where there were better resources. But that cavity in particular, a wall or the side of a shed or the floor of a shed, is a very common place that I remove bees from, and that's because it's a commonplace. Bees choose to live. It replicates what I mean. It's so ideal for what the bees want in an environment. It almost is the same kind of width of a beehive, that space in between the floor. They like a closed environment that's climate controlled with a small entrance that they can easily defend. They like it protected from the weather and from the elements. And they need a lot of space in those backyard sheds. People tend to not go in them very often, and the bees aren't bothered by people. So that's a pretty common place that I'll do removals from.
[ 0:03:30.000 ---> 0:03:41.000 ] Speaker B : So when you go to a place like that and you see them, that's how you know you don't need an outfit, because you were just like, well, now you're all suited up.
[ 0:03:41.000 ---> 0:03:52.000 ] Speaker A : So I saw Zod through that, and sometimes they don't like the vibrations of the tools that I'm using, and this is the first. I have no idea what to expect of how defensive they'll be.
[ 0:03:52.000 ---> 0:04:04.000 ] Speaker B : So this is your first exposure to these particular bees. So you're cutting through for the folks that are just listening. She's at a shed, and she's sawing through the side of this shed where.
[ 0:04:05.000 ---> 0:04:06.000 ] Speaker A : The bees were using my saw.
[ 0:04:08.000 ---> 0:04:13.000 ] Speaker B : There's your voice. Very common, soothing, and. Are you getting stung here?
[ 0:04:13.000 ---> 0:04:17.000 ] Speaker A : No, these bees are not trying to sting me at all.
[ 0:04:19.000 ---> 0:04:24.000 ] Speaker B : This is wild. So they've developed these combs in these.
[ 0:04:25.000 ---> 0:04:27.000 ] Speaker A : Almost like you can see the honey right there.
[ 0:04:27.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, but it's almost like a commercial beehive sort of set up.
[ 0:04:32.000 ---> 0:04:38.000 ] Speaker A : If you think of dividing that wall up and stacking them on top of each other, that's a traditional beehive.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:04:44.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. So now you've gotten rid of the mask and you're still just handling this.
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker A : Sure.
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker B : You just took a bite of it. You're a psycho. There's bees there.
[ 0:04:49.000 ---> 0:04:52.000 ] Speaker A : I've been working hard. That was a long removal.
[ 0:04:52.000 ---> 0:04:59.000 ] Speaker B : I know, but there's bees flying around your face, and you're just biting into that honeycomb. There's bees all over that thing.
[ 0:04:59.000 ---> 0:05:04.000 ] Speaker A : There really aren't. I mean, they're not what? They're not trying to sting me. There are a lot of bees there.
[ 0:05:04.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker B : I understand. But you just took a bite with bees to the left and the right of your mouth.
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker A : I tell you what, you're watching me at my most joyful moments. I love doing this.
[ 0:05:15.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker B : That's your most joyful moment, to just take a bite out of their house?
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker A : No, but this whole removal process, there's nothing I'd rather be doing.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker B : That's what you love to do the most, is find them.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:06:01.000 ] Speaker A : I almost wish someone could monitor my brain and watch it light up as I do this work, because there's so many points that are just so exciting throughout the process. I don't really know what to expect beforehand. So I get there and I see the hive for the first time, and I go, wow, it might fill the whole wall. And sure enough, then once I saw through the side and get through it, it does, and there's definitely another dopamine hit when I first see that beehive. And just like you said, wow, look at that comb. I mean, for me, it's times ten.
[ 0:06:01.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker B : And for the folks listening, this is a massive comb. This whole thing looks like it's about 12ft tall. And the comb goes all the way up the side in six or seven different rows. So there's like, how many bees are in there? If you had to take a wild.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker A : Guess, I hate doing this, but maybe 200,000, 250,000. That is a large beehive. Those bees have been there for some time. And not only do we know because of the size, but also the age of the color of the comb. So you can see that it's darker, it's almost dark brown. And if you think of, oh, that's a beautiful shot of the comb with a bunch of pollen. So it's full of those brightly colored, different. See, there's even some white pollen at the top. There's white and orange and yellow and red colored pollen mixed in with some nectar. And the pollen is the bee's protein source. So pollen is actually a great source of protein. I think there's, like 2 grams of protein per tablespoon of pollen, pound for pound. It's a better source of pollen than beef or chicken, but most better source of protein. Better source of protein. Thank you.
[ 0:07:11.000 ---> 0:07:12.000 ] Speaker B : Is it as bioavailable?
[ 0:07:12.000 ---> 0:07:14.000 ] Speaker A : But most people aren't going to eat a pound of pollen, of course.
[ 0:07:14.000 ---> 0:07:15.000 ] Speaker B : Is it gross?
[ 0:07:16.000 ---> 0:07:23.000 ] Speaker A : It doesn't have much of a taste or flavor to me. It kind of tastes like wheatgrass almost.
[ 0:07:25.000 ---> 0:07:26.000 ] Speaker B : Put in a shake or something.
[ 0:07:26.000 ---> 0:07:31.000 ] Speaker A : Yes, it's very mild. Not much flavor, in my opinion.
[ 0:07:31.000 ---> 0:07:40.000 ] Speaker B : Is it as bioavailable as like chicken or beef, because you know that there's certain plant proteins that aren't that bioavailable. Even though there's a high gram of protein per ounce.
[ 0:07:41.000 ---> 0:07:55.000 ] Speaker A : We wouldn't want to harvest as much pollen from bees as we do other protein sources, of course, and this is their food source, so we shouldn't really be to take.
[ 0:07:55.000 ---> 0:07:55.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, no, I'm not.
