- Can we keep playing the okay, good. We turn it up a little bit so it's more pump up. Can you put on the presentation? That'll be about the most pump up thing that ever happens in enterprise software. The rest is sort of downhill from here.
- Marin Levy is CEO and co founder of Box. He is trying to convince students that they want to build an enterprise software company. Hopefully we'll be able to kind of work through this.
- Box founder talks about why the company decided to go after enterprise software. Also talks about the factors that make it possible to do a startup today in this category. And finally, some ways to recognize and ways to build an enterprise software company yourself.
- Box has about 240,000 businesses that use the product. There are over 27 million users that have brought box into their organization. We're in about 99% of the Fortune 500. The last 1% is really just Microsoft and they don't seem to want to buy from us.
- Back in 2004, it was like really hard to share files. Box. Net was created to make it easy to store and share files from anywhere. Today, the cost of storage has dropped dramatically. Always look for changing technology factors.
- In the enterprise, there's actually $3.7 trillion spent on enterprise It every single year. The problem was that enterprise software was really, really unsexy to build a business. Founder: The notion of having a sales intermediary to get to your customer seemed like really unappealing.
- Most application categories are moving to the cloud. The platforms themselves are becoming more global. The most profound shift of all is that because of mobile devices, the enterprise has become a lot more user led. This is probably the most magical time to build an enterprise software company.
- Every company, every industry is going to have a technology component of what they do. Enterprises will not be able to survive in the future if they don't get good at technology. There's going to be a lot of partnership over the next five to ten years.
- The first is spot technology disruptions and this is going to be true whether you're building consumer or enterprise. You have to look for new enabling technologies or major, major trends. Something that was impossible five or ten years ago all of a sudden becomes very practical.
- In the enterprise, you want to start intentionally small. You want to find what are the gaps in the full solution. Over time you're going to be able to expand again either to larger customers or to more use cases. A great example is Zen payroll. Now they're able to move both upmarket over time.
- You want to do things that incumbents can't or won't do because either the economics don't make sense for them or the economics are so different. The next is you want to find the really crazy but sort of still somewhat reasonable outliers within the customer ecosystem. Find what is missing when you're working in the future.
