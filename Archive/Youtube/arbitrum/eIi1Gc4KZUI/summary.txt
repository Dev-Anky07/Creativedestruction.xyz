- The Dex Wars panel features David Defai from Trader Joe and AJ boots from Camelot. Vlad, Co is the founder and CEO of Lighter. Peter is on the partnership team at Offchain Labs and will be the moderator for this panel.
- Do you believe one Dex will have majority market share in the future, or will it be more fragmented? For us, the focus is really to build the most efficient way to trade the most liquid tokens. A diverse space is healthy and everything we need in order for anyone to thrive.
- As decentralized exchanges continue to evolve, how do you see their impact on traditional centralized exchanges and the broader financial industry? We are all here to push retail towards onchain activities. People also want the best user experience on chain.
- Cavalott is building its own product and build true builders. Our protocol is 100% research and custom built by our great engineers. We already have our own roadmap of things that know are needed and very excited to quickly iterate. Can you tell us what some of those future advancements may be?
- Most DEXes are desktop based, but a lot of us are on mobile. Trader Joe has always prioritized with UI UX to be a mobile first company. Making DeFi accessible means being mobile first.
- Vlad, I have a specific question for you. AMMS are certainly popular in crypto. Can you share why your team went with an order book based model? Definitely. We want to build the most efficient infrastructure to trade liquid tokens.
- The majority of our effort since we launched in November has been to really build close relationships with builders. And I think what we have is our Roundtable. Most of the biggest Arbitrage protocols have a stake in Camelot, in Grail. I would love for us to still be a big catalyst for Arbitram in the future.
- David, your team came from the avalanche ecosystem and has made a successful migration over to Arbitrum. Adex thrives in a vibrant ecosystem where interesting tokens are offered and interesting protocols build on top of your protocol. Building true relationship with projects on a blockchain is fundamental.
- One surprising thing has been that the kind of shift of volume from CFI to DeFi would have been faster. On the positive side, the DeFi ecosystem itself has been quite welcoming and easy to navigate. But I think we all probably want to see a faster shift.
- The key take that I like to share is to not chase the trend. The main thing that we emphasize is to have poll because you turn then your liquidity from a cost to an actual source of revenue. Taking the long term approach is the right way and not making shortcuts.
- Well, this has been fun, gentlemen. Appreciate your time and I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the event. Cheers.
