- What was once a mistreated Soviet state has gone on to be the largest and wealthiest economy in Central Asia. Kazakhstan hasn't and won't have it easy in its quest to become a properly developed nation. But that doesn't mean that they can't do it.
- Kazakhstan is the largest landlocked country in the world. The country is home to some of the largest deposits of various natural resources. It was exploited by the Soviets following the fall of the Russian empire. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan had to embrace the free market.
- Kazakhstan is a member of the CIS, or Commonwealth of Independent States. Kazakhstan has strong diplomatic and economic relations with China, Russia, and the United States. China is also more than happy to extend the olive branch to Kazakhstan because it is such a central piece of its belt and road initiative.
- The nation's GDP of $179,000,000.000 as of 2018 is far from its peak. But it still does make it a decently, powerful economy in its own right. But its historical overreliance on fossil fuels means that this growth is not sustainable. The transition to an economy with light government influence will likely pay off.
