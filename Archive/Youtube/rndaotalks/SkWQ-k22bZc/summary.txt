- Daniel Ospina welcomes Dave Snowden to Rndao. Snowden is a leading authority in the field of systems thinking. He says complexity is a science, not a way of thinking, it's actually a science science. At any stage during the interview, feel free to change the agenda or move things around.
- Today's talk focuses on design thinking, or rather design methodology, design approaches. How do you design a system so that things you don't know yet you want, but you will know after you've seen them, can emerge more naturally?
- The first thing we want to do is distributed Ethnography, which is mass discovery of issues or problems. Step number two is distributed ideation. The big thing we develop is called high abstraction signification. abstraction is really key to innovation.
- I just republished a 30 year old framework about known, unknown and unknowables. The real danger is the things your organization knows, but the decision makers are unaware of. Unknown knowns are actually a major opportunity in companies. We need to find ways to radically repurpose existing capability for scarily unknowable needs.
- A lot of people run creativity programs in the hope that they will create innovation. Innovation comes out of starvation pressure and perspective shift. Both the innovation and the behavior are emergent properties of context. You need all three present for innovation to form.
- The other big area we worked about was when we started to work on Scaffolding. We came up with a typology of scaffolding. The way we're moving on this on software design at the moment is say people are objects too. It's not engineering design, it's ecological design.
- The latest thing we're doing is Esterine mapping. This is actually, I think, going to be bigger than Knevin. The only thing you can manage in a complex adaptive system is constraints. We want micro constraints as well as much as macro constraints.
- We're currently in negotiation with one of the Welsh health boards to basically entangle patient stories with medical stories. So we can create an empirical measure of when the community can support early discharge. There is an opportunity to do a club of different health boards who are interested in running an experiment.
- More abstract the better, is my general view. We're now starting to use pictures and symbols, so we're moving into semiotics rather than language. In theory, that should produce better innovation than language, because the abstraction is more likely to create novel connections.
- Distributed decision making is very different because you're distributing into a combination of functions. You get more decisions with fewer levels of hierarchy, so you get more visibility, more transparency and more knowledge exchange. Could save 20% to 30% of the administrative cost of the NHS out if you switch to distributed decision making.
- High abstraction is not generalization. It actually creates completely novel associations. It's actually going down a level because I want to combine data at a metadata level.
- Can gamba be also be used in scrutinizing information? I mean both in the military context but also in finance because there's considerable disinformation making autopsy disinformation or corrupt data. Could we emphasize the focus on trends and drivers to indefinite scope?
- Energy gradient of sin seems to be higher than the energy gradient of virtue, because sin is more prevalent. What you're trying to do is change the environment so individuals follow pathways. It's about the energy change required to change the system, not the people.
- I'm arriving here as a classroom teacher here in the United States. I'm fairly new to system thinking. I think your take on it, especially in how you provide a contrast to the engineering side of things, is really compelling.
- Would you be willing to speak briefly on how you would approach sense making and constraints management in the school setting? Sengi and Shamiga to me are two major causes of problems worldwide at the moment. New Age movements distract people from engaging with the politics.
-  systems thinking is a general name for a whole series of things. My problem with soft systems, it doesn't scale beyond the workshop. The other thing is behavioralism. Skinner was a disaster if you look at it. Any other sacred cows anybody wants me to take down?
- We instead of mindset, we talk about affordance, agency and assemblage. You don't need sense maker. You can just use brainstorming. All of our methods are open source. We're interested in mentoring people through this.
- Affordance comes from know a cactus will not thrive in a tropical rainforest. It's what opportunities are afforded to you by the environment. Agency is who or what in what combinations can actually do something.
- Complexity theory has moved from early adopter to early majority in marketing terms. We're now at the stage where it's practical tools and techniques which are theoretically sound, but people can understand. People can pick it up without even knowing the theory and they can make sense of it.
- Dave, you've been criticizing human maturity models. What is your take on the organizational lifecycle theory? It's like the forest cycle. No organization is ever in one system anyway. Human beings are much more context specific than we realize.
- Dave, thank you so much for all of these, really appreciate it. I'm also highly interested in apprenticeship learning opportunities from Kinefin. Get in touch. Have a lovely rest of the day.
