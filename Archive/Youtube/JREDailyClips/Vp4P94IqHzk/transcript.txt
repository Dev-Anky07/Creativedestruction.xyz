[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:26.000 ] Speaker A : Like, like the way my mom loved me. She passed away a couple years ago. But give me a second. Like, I could have been gay. I could have been in jail. I could have been flunking out of school. Could have been mean to her. I could have been anything. And I know that she would have loved me the exact same way. Yeah. And because she did.
[ 0:00:29.000 ---> 0:00:31.000 ] Speaker B : You are the person you are.
[ 0:00:31.000 ---> 0:00:36.000 ] Speaker A : I wanted to make her proud. Yeah, I still do. I think this project is just an homage to her.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker B : Well, you're very fortunate.
[ 0:00:40.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, yeah. I don't know anybody that had a mom like mine. And my dad was great, too. Not as great, but my dad was really great.
