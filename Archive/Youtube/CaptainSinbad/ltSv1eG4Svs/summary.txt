- In art, the more personalized you are, the better. It's better to make personalized decisions rather than generic ones. When HBO launched True Detective, that really took to the hearts and minds of millions, it's because True Detective became specific.
- The status game is deeply implicated in the great human hungers. Money and fitness are foundational to status, but they are not the thing itself. Too many people confuse the foundation behind them, the money and the fitness, with status itself.
- Where does your status come from in the modern world? How can you bring it to its full potential to really make a dent in the world? Choose an archetype because it is your competitive advantage in life.
- An important aspect of this regard is that you should never hyphenate your archetype. You want to create a vision around what like the final form version of your archetype could be. Clothes really can make the man. You're going to build up status by becoming very well known.
- The third idea then, is organizations, brands, and events. Choose a platform where you house your branding and identity. Find partnerships with brands that people would recognize or associate you with. Create dream partnerships that you would eventually want to work towards.
- Captain Sinbad YouTuber Group Coaching Academy is looking to help YouTubers get to 100,000 subscribers and beyond on YouTube. Having a brand that people can associate with you is the only way to market yourself in the 21st century. We have a limited number of slots for our next cohort starting in June.
- You could readily form connections with places that are already in some people's mental space. You can form partnerships, and that's what you definitely need to do. No matter your station, you could at least make a list of brands or organization connections that you could make.
- The final front of this, then, is events. Events are actually the most high status thing you could do for yourself. They help solidify your vision of yourself, your archetype of yourself into an action. These steps, they build very slowly, but they're incredibly rewarding.
- There's a very fine line between actually doing the thing and then just trying to look like you're doing it. Be the thing for real, and that is the most high status version of yourself you could be. The heart of status lies in building up that archetype and working towards some event.
