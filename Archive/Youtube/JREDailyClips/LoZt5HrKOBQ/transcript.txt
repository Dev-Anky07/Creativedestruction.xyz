[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:14.000 ] Speaker A : Imagine always checking up on it, check in on people. And you open the door and someone's been knifed to death, and you're like, holy shit. And you're just realizing, you're trying to turn the lights on. Like, what the fuck's going on? And he's an illegal immigrant. He's from another country.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:14.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker C : So he tried to hide, and then.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker A : The woman blames it on him. And it's just crazy. And it's such a flawed system. And the thing is, there's an incentive for a prosecutor once they're starting to try a case. They want to win that fucking case. They got a record, they have a reputation, and so they're trying to win. And when it's like, a government prosecutor or a district attorney and they know there's some information that would exonerate that person, they're just like.
[ 0:00:43.000 ---> 0:00:46.000 ] Speaker C : That seems like a problem, making it, like, competitive for lawyers.
[ 0:00:46.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker A : It's very bad.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:51.000 ] Speaker C : Be like, I want to win. They're like DAs that are like, I arrested the most people.
[ 0:00:51.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker A : Exactly.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah. Then they run for office and it's like, remember that?
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:01:02.000 ] Speaker C : And they're like, I was tough on crime. And then all of a sudden, ten years later, being tough on crime is racist. I wasn't tough on crime. Now I smoke weed. President.
[ 0:01:03.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker A : I didn't call him super criminal.
[ 0:01:09.000 ---> 0:01:10.000 ] Speaker C : That's crazy.
[ 0:01:10.000 ---> 0:01:11.000 ] Speaker A : That's crazy.
[ 0:01:11.000 ---> 0:01:16.000 ] Speaker D : He's getting jammed up on Manila folders when he was, like, kissing twelve year old girls on camera.
[ 0:01:16.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know Joe Biden. I don't know jack shit about politics. But if I had to guess, they're trying to get rid of him. Yeah. My guess would be they're trying to get rid of him. If all of a sudden his own aides are sending these instead of, like, taking these classified documents, which you have located, and go, well, let's not do that again. And fucking locking them up somewhere. His own AIDS.
[ 0:01:41.000 ---> 0:01:44.000 ] Speaker C : Self reporting, dude, come on.
[ 0:01:44.000 ---> 0:01:48.000 ] Speaker A : That sounds sus. Well, no one self reported that fucking laptop.
[ 0:01:48.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker D : I know.
[ 0:01:49.000 ---> 0:01:52.000 ] Speaker C : Well, that was Russian disinformation. That reeks of Russian.
[ 0:01:52.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : They got a hold of the social media companies and lied to them. They did whatever the fuck they could to keep that from happening. And even tHis, they discovered this before the midterms. Yeah. They didn't release the information until after the mean.
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:20.000 ] Speaker D : Everyone said this a million times with the news. If that was flip flopped, if it was Trump's kid, that would have been all over. It would have been like, this is the fate of our democracy. Rest in the sunscreen. Blah blah, blah.
[ 0:02:20.000 ---> 0:02:22.000 ] Speaker A : And the media would have gone right along with it.
[ 0:02:22.000 ---> 0:02:22.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:02:22.000 ---> 0:02:31.000 ] Speaker D : And it's, like, so obvious and it sounds trite, but it's like, dude, why do. What's the incentive to be like, nah, fuck that guy, not that guy. That kind of freaks me out, dude.
[ 0:02:31.000 ---> 0:03:07.000 ] Speaker A : There'S a bunch of us that are just unrepresented. It's the reasonable middle. The reasonable middle of the world. Unrepresented. You've got radical left and radical right. You got people that are all in on the Republican Party and you should never get an abortion even if you've been raped. You got wild shit on that side. And on the other side, you got men can get pregnant. You got all this chaos. You got FTX. He was just making mistakes. No big deal. We should barely even attack him. We don't even need to bring him in. Come on, guys.
[ 0:03:07.000 ---> 0:03:10.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah. Why would they let that guy off the hook?
[ 0:03:10.000 ---> 0:03:18.000 ] Speaker A : Number two donor to the Democratic Party. Oh, duh. Number two, just buy George Soros. And they're like, whatever. No one's freaking out.
[ 0:03:20.000 ---> 0:03:28.000 ] Speaker C : The Republicans hanging on to that Santos dude. That is why the Republicans are like, no, he's a good dude. That guy should be in jail. Santos is the guy. He was like, I'm Jewish.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:29.000 ] Speaker E : Oh, that's.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:33.000 ] Speaker C : And they were like, you're not Jewish. And he's like, I meant Jewish. I'm like a Jew.
[ 0:03:34.000 ---> 0:03:38.000 ] Speaker A : He's a master of the English language. He's a master of the English language. He lied about so many things.
[ 0:03:38.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker C : He lied about everything.
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:03:41.000 ] Speaker A : I found out about it on the podcast and then a deep dive.
[ 0:03:41.000 ---> 0:03:48.000 ] Speaker C : I'm like, wild. I was looking at him yesterday. The first article that came up was like, he lied about being a volleyball star.
[ 0:03:50.000 ---> 0:03:57.000 ] Speaker A : You ever see Biden lie about his education? Have you ever seen that clip where he lied about his education? They fact checked him on the news.
[ 0:03:58.000 ---> 0:03:59.000 ] Speaker D : WhaT did he say? He was.
[ 0:03:59.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, my God. Flat out lied about his credentials.
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:08.000 ] Speaker C : I think it fucked him up in that debate he was running a while ago and he got.
[ 0:04:08.000 ---> 0:04:10.000 ] Speaker A : Well, he ran for president in.
[ 0:04:10.000 ---> 0:04:12.000 ] Speaker C : He, like, plagiarized the speech, dude.
[ 0:04:12.000 ---> 0:04:22.000 ] Speaker A : We used to do Joe Biden Night at Stitch's Comedy Club in Boston, where we'd all do each other's acts. That time, Joe Biden lied about his academic credentials. So watch this video because it's fucking crazy.
[ 0:04:22.000 ---> 0:04:25.000 ] Speaker C : He was 76 of 80. He was so silly.
[ 0:04:26.000 ---> 0:04:28.000 ] Speaker D : He might have got it wrong, though. He might have been, like, 85.
[ 0:04:28.000 ---> 0:04:34.000 ] Speaker C : Truthfully, a guy who finishes 76 would get it wrong to the White House.
[ 0:04:34.000 ---> 0:04:37.000 ] Speaker A : No, this is the video I've seen is he argues with this guy.
[ 0:04:37.000 ---> 0:04:40.000 ] Speaker F : And the other question is, could you quickly?
[ 0:04:41.000 ---> 0:05:19.000 ] Speaker E : I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do. I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship. In the first year in law school, I decided didn't want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two thirds of my class and then decided I wanted to stay, went back to law school, and in fact, ended up in the top half of my class. I won the International Moot Court competition. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits. Only need 123 credits. And I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like, Frank.
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker C : You rewind that and look at the guy who wants to fucking see how.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:24.000 ] Speaker D : Happy that guy was.
[ 0:05:25.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker C : You're doing it.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker F : I am not questioning your IQ. I'm just saying that with the people that we have elected to office in recent years, I think that we have to question their credentials very solidly.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:52.000 ] Speaker E : Well, I think you're right, Frank. Damn. But you know what I find kind of interesting? It seems to me, if you can speak, you're at a liability in the Democratic Party anymore. It seems to me you've all become heartless technocrats. It seems to me that you forget that what happens is we've never, as a party.
[ 0:05:52.000 ---> 0:05:54.000 ] Speaker A : Okay, pause. ThIs is now nonsense.
[ 0:05:55.000 ---> 0:05:56.000 ] Speaker C : Biden rules. Yeah.
[ 0:05:56.000 ---> 0:06:06.000 ] Speaker A : Now go to the article where it says what his actual stats were because someone fact checked him on the news. It's not in that clip. There's one that they played that clip on the news and then fact checked it.
[ 0:06:06.000 ---> 0:06:12.000 ] Speaker D : That'd be a nice edit. Like cutting that to now him just fucking bumbling around on stage talking nonsense.
[ 0:06:12.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker A : He's actually 70th in a class of 85. So he wasn't in the top half. But there was a bunch of other stuff that he lied about in that clip, too. In the news clip where they check it, this hardcore news guy goes, actually, the true story is. And he just lays it all out.
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, that blows.
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:31.000 ] Speaker A : It sucks.
[ 0:06:31.000 ---> 0:06:34.000 ] Speaker C : Imagine if you're lying to do the.
[ 0:06:34.000 ---> 0:06:39.000 ] Speaker G : New questions stemmed from taped remarks of Biden during an April campaign appearance in New Hampshire.
[ 0:06:40.000 ---> 0:06:43.000 ] Speaker E : I went to law school on a full academic scholarship.
[ 0:06:47.000 ---> 0:06:49.000 ] Speaker A : That's okay. Keep playing. That's crazy.
[ 0:06:49.000 ---> 0:07:05.000 ] Speaker E : In my class, I'd have a full academic scholarship, went back to law school, and in fact, ended up in the top half of my class. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school, 165 credits only need 123 credits.
[ 0:07:05.000 ---> 0:07:15.000 ] Speaker H : Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.
[ 0:07:15.000 ---> 0:07:23.000 ] Speaker B : Newsweek says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom of his class and won only one degree, not three.
[ 0:07:23.000 ---> 0:07:33.000 ] Speaker I : Joe Biden ranked 76th in a class of 85 at the University of Syracuse Law School. I mean, this guy comes off this whole thing as a flyweight now, Biden says. Maybe we can right?
[ 0:07:33.000 ---> 0:07:35.000 ] Speaker G : His memory had failed.
[ 0:07:35.000 ---> 0:07:48.000 ] Speaker A : His memory had failed, but his memory seems so good right there. That would be so scary if you could rat. Maybe those are the early signs of dementia. You could rattle off facts you think are fact.
[ 0:07:48.000 ---> 0:07:49.000 ] Speaker D : Oh boy. Maybe.
