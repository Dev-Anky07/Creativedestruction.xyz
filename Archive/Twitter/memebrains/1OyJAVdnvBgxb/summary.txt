- Lam you. Here for everyone in the mid and eastern hemispheres BGM all around. Lots of really cool familiar faces just as we're waiting. If you don't mind sharing the space on your Twitter, just know, reshare the tweet. We started also a substac to follow up on all these spaces in a Telegram group.
- This is a Twitter space about DAOs, dao governance, and more specifically about incentives and rewards within DAOs. What incentive experiments are you currently implementing in your organization? Do you think that maybe on the flip side, punishments maybe are better than incentives?
- We have some awesome speakers lined up today. Some of them are on the space right now. Some will be joining in a second. We have lots to talk about.
- Just put your hand up if you want to speak or you have a question. Please, no money price speculation, no market talks, any of that stuff. This is a forum to share, discuss, and have fun.
- Do you think that having an incentive in a Dow is a good thing or a bad thing? There are two camps on this thought, and both have very good points. There's a couple of different types of incentives. It depends on the type of Dao that you're talking about.
- The NNS Dao controls upgrades to the actual protocol itself. To review all protocol changes and ensure that the code is correct would take an enormous amount of skill and time. I think compensation kind of needs to be there.
- A salary in and of itself is an incentive. How could incentives be bad? Punkar is up next. I think the incentives are just changing and becoming more than only the salaries or only the financial part of it.
- Gaia, you're up next here and then we have Live Fast and Gift and Nishant. I'm leading the research on rewards and compensation. There are almost like around 30 different ways we could name these things. There is no good or bad. It depends of who you are, what is your relationship, type of contribution.
- Lufast: How do we get more people actively involved and engaged. As for incentives, we have an issue where we didn't really pay people to do things. Paying people to get things that you want done actually helps keep it going, Lufast says.
- We assume that people buy an NFT for a dow to join the dow and participate in the dow. A lot of times people actually buy these NFTs not to participate. How can we incentivize those that have never voted to start voting or to start participating?
- At Kift, we're a co living dow that started with Van Life, expanding to tiny homes, looking to create a network of eco villages. While our participation has been low, the quality of the participation are actually people living on site together. That quality over quantity sets the foundation for success.
- How can we intrinsically motivate people to want to contribute to what we're building without having a dollar amount tied to it? The solution is by having a rewarding experience, starting with your team culture. The broader vision I think, helps the momentum get going.
- Maim: There is a fundamental basic type of reward system based on emotion that perhaps supersedes financial altogether. Nishant, you're up next. And then after that, lions origami Sandella.
- LOMADS is a tool for permissions and compensation. From an organization's perspective, it really comes down to the goals and the values. Compensation will not work if you don't have enough to pay your bills. The behavior that we are seeing today is going to change when the demographic changes.
- The most important thing of scaling this kind of a dao is by curating a healthy environment where people are excited to contribute. Different types of Dows include protocol and financial dows and NFT Dows. The incentive programs have to be a little bit more intricate.
- A community driven Dao like Kiftao would have a very different dynamic and intention than would uniswap Dao where it's very financially oriented. That's a really good perspective. Well, thank you for making this space lovely.
- How do we collectively decide to give incentives instead of leaving the incentives to be given on an individual basis? I want to think that incentives are a good thing for us to have. Maybe we're not yet at the best we can be on understanding the best ways to giving incentives.
- I'm really curious to hear what your thoughts are on incentives and rewards in DAOs. Sandella, you're up next here. If there's anything that you've heard here that triggers a thought, I'd love you.
- Sandy: Most people are motivated by having agency, having ownership, or a sense of accomplishment. Research shows that people that are more publicly service oriented or motivated will be highly motivated to do something that's based on Public Good. Knowing who your community Is would be a really good way to measure what kinds of incentives would be working well in Your Dao.
- Sandella: I'm actually curious to know more about Miami Dow. I'd love to maybe even do an episode with you and hear more about what Miamida is doing. Let's definitely keep in touch here.
- Jordan: I think leadership is very desirable. With the technologies that we have now, it's possible to have leadership with accountability. Some Dows take where we're kind of recreating existing political structures inside the Dow. Is there a sweet spot in the middle or is there just certain changes that need to happen?
- Jordan: I think there's a lot of wisdom in the past. Centralization of power is very dangerous. But it's not necessarily evil or wrong. It's just dangerous if you can control it. I'm not sure we should burn down all existing structures.
- David Wheeler: I like to think that organizations if we're building organizations as software. He says incentives and rewards are naturally going to be less standardized in DAOs than they are in corporations. Wheeler: If we're very successful with DAOs, my prediction is that eventually DAOs will overtake them.
- King Blueberry: I've missed so many votes because I didn't actually know they were happening. For us, we're building DeFi applications. What we're planning on building is a way to notify people when there is a vote happening. It might be able to attract more people to those kind of votes.
- King Blueberry: For me, myself, I try to be as active as I possibly can in Telegram and discord and everywhere, but I always miss those communications. If a Dao is stronger in one communication platform than another, there's certain people in the Dao that are just going to get left out.
- Voter apathy is a thing in pretty much every social dao. I don't think voting is necessarily one of the main values in a Dow. implementing some sort of qualitative way to measure someone's contributions even before the vote could actually incentivize things that are maybe even more beneficial than a vote.
- Incentive is about wanting to help and wanting to be a part of something cool. It's just making people feel good, making them feel heard and appreciated. That sort of is an incentive in and of itself to participate more.
- Nishant: The problems that we see will be visible here, but maybe in new manifestations. Technology is definitely making us catch up with all the mess that we are in. But the problem spaces where things are changing, patterns are emergent, it's much harder. Next up is Kift.
- When we think about incentives and rewards, it's hard for us to imagine someone reviewing all decisions that are going on in a Dow as they scale. As we start to look at broader kind of work stream operations, I think it gets a little more challenging.
- GPT founder: Emotional motivation to me still might be at the root of all dows. Love that so many other people are amplifying the mission and the values. The importance of mission aligned action and clearly defined values to guide an organization.
- I'm also curious what kind of incentive or reward programs you may have done in Miami dow either now or in the past and were they successful or were they not successful? How does that change from one boss to a structure where everybody's, a peer and a boss and a choice maker change as incentives?
- Cindel: Miami Dow has a lot of potential, and I think it needs some more motivation. One of the things that is complicated when you're starting a dow and it's new is really trying to define what Is The purpose? Mindfulness is the best way to solve that problem.
- I'm fascinated with the concept of the network state. I see a lot of value in some of the contributors, and I want to see this vision manifest. No dow is really perfect. But joining eight Dow and just getting a really good onboarding welcome, it makes me want to contribute more.
-  Lyons: If you want people to truly lean in and dedicate themselves to what your Dao is doing, there needs to be incentive structures. Lyons: They can obviously take many forms, being financial, reputational, a bunch of different exclusive benefits. I think healthy environment is the key, but there must be incentive in order for a Dow to scale.
-  Gaia and Ernst of Gaia are writing a book on incentive and rewards. Is there anything that's surprised you so far with some of the feedback or input that people have provided? The only thing is the communication and a language and we don't have it yet.
- I'm going to do a shout out here to just curious. There's people listening that I haven't heard from. Whatever it is that's on your mind as you're listening, love to hear it. Matai, you're up next.
- Kift is building a culture of how to collaborate, how to communicate. The company has 70 plus people sharing space together, cooking together, cleaning together. The emphasis has been on nonviolent communication. Kift wants to create more spaces for these types of conversations.
- Dr. Tammy: I have an idea for a dow. How can I sustain those that the community and those who are coming into the community over a long period? How do we start incentivizing before the real incentive or the monetary incentives? Live Fast here if you want to chime in speaker stage.
- Deja: How do you grow the Dow from there with just like some baseline NFTs or whatever token you have? And that is definitely a harder issue and one that I am trying to figure out. Those are big topics, man, and I hope we get to chat about them more.
- Ernest: If we see Web Three as an environment where people tend to cooperate, where trust can be built, this opens up the ability to address the diversity of human needs. He says if we have tools that are building trust, opening up communication, enabling us to request and share our needs with each other.
- If you want to join them as a speaker, just put your hand up. And I'm curious what's on your mind as you're listening to some of this. What are like the top priorities that you're trying to accomplish in your Dow in the next 30 days?
- The biggest thing that I want to always encourage is give everybody a chance to talk. Our big thing right now is we do grants programs. What makes you show up every day to the project? I kind of like it.
- We run a grant program and it's open to anybody when we have. If you have any idea of any dream or idea in Whitrey, we want to hear about it and then we vote on it as a community. Two of the three people who are our current winners of this current round. They're four weeks in on the six week program.
- There are some Dow tools that allow you to assign points to tasks. The more we can decentralize the bounty programs and the compensation programs, the better. I think Dwork has a lot of potential. I struggled a little bit with the UI.
- Hey, I also posted an article on the thread here. It talks about how incentive programs often can change short term behavior, but not like long term behavior. In some cases, throwing an incentive structure in there can also start to trigger infighting right people competing with each other. I'm curious what your thoughts are on some of this.
- One thing is I think reciprocal in collaborative environments you'll have more reciprocal relationships. I'm interested in learning what will rewards, compensation and incentives look like for reciprocal relationships that are built on trust.
- We got Raphael that just joined the space here. He's a startup founder out in Santa Clara area. His community is about 60,000 users currently. Let's all think about how we can create more reciprocal incentive systems. Looking forward to the next one.
- In the last four months, we pivoted to help businesses boost their social media pages. How our system works is that businesses pay monthly subscriptions to our platform. People that are performing those tasks earn our token and they can swap this token to money that is inside of the pool.
- You're working with micro taskers that are trying to generate income. What are some of the biggest lessons you picked up on how to motivate a big audience? My big lesson was not to use my own money to incentivize people. Recently signed a pretty big contract with Know the Metaverse game.
- And maybe if I piggyback off the Metaverse topic, I know Cloud the Boy here. Metaverse is his thing. If you felt like chiming in, you can feel free. I think we might be wrapping up the space in a couple of minutes here.
- There was this big issue where people would have issues trying to get in communication with other people in the Dow. Certain Dows will just use, let's say, telegram or WhatsApp or whatever. Is that an actual major problem across most Dows or just like here and there?
- Thank you and welcome. Great to have you back and curious how your dao is going. I think I might possibly wrap things up here, and I'm going to be doing an article, write up. If you want to keep these conversations going, just join the telegram group.
- All right. Thanks, everyone. I got a lot out of this. We're going to do another space next month. I think we might go into the nonviolent communication topic. Until then, just keep on building keep your chin up, right?
