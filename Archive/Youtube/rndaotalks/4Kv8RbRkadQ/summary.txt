- Dowd: I feel very deeply called to focus on leadership. I think it's indicative of what leadership in the future that is more decentralized and more able to allow for everyone to step into their own leadership. So I'm so excited that you've all joined to hear and learn a little bit more about leadership in Dows.
- Leadership in DAOs can come in a lot of different ways. I think that's much more important in Dows is having the structure rather than having the person. So a couple of questions that I want you to contemplate and feel free to add your thoughts into the chat.
- There's a lot of different opportunities for leadership within Dows, whether it's more hierarchical, if it's flat. Catherine: Is there a future for leadership? How would it look? How can we move away from traditional view of leadership? Grace: I'm just an R and Dao fanboy. Love it.
- In 2018, I was tasked to find out what are the capabilities on the horizon that we need skill leaders up in within the Dow ecosystem. What became more clear in 2020, 2021 is I started mining helium and started seeing helium as a use case for a decentralized version of telecommunications. We think that leadership in Dows is a dynamic emergent group property in which people flexibly lead one another.
- The idea is that that shifts in this more decentralized world to being more of a dynamic process. What do we find that's been true of leadership research in the past that we also believe still holds relevance for a more decentralized future of work?
- My thinking on leadership in DAOs has evolved to the personal leadership and personal fortitude being even more critical. If you're looking to strengthen leadership within your Dow, something that you can do is really focus on how are you appreciating the people.
- What do you all see as some of the greatest leadership challenges and needs today? A lack of a clear direction that's communicated throughout the organization. A lot of times people could be really galvanized if they were in line with the narrative.
- It's hard to influence people without a more humanity and it's very hard to explain that to people today. The most helpful onboarding experiences now consist more of mentorship and having a live conversation.
- Jean Alvier: I see leadership as a multifaceted concept and I like being exposed to different approaches. The future of work to me has even more porous boundaries between nation states, between governments, between Dows. It also still requires that nuanced look at what does this mean for different cultures.
- Daniel: There's some key ingredients to even allow for shared leadership. The three key ingredients are shared purpose, social support and voice. We were really intentional about recruiting in a way that represented the future we wanted to see.
- Leadership in Dows is multifaceted, so it takes on different dynamics. Many just experienced extreme burnout. Some ended up quitting their more prominent Dow. And what often led people to their upswing in their journey.
- What's working well for me is choosing sort of like a niche role and sticking to it. Do something right, especially in the beginning is pretty powerful. Where are you at in your own personal journey and what's working and where are you getting stuck?
- Michael Strummer: Success means having an influence on my peers, feeling safe to take risks. What is Mojo over ego? When you're trying to create and cultivate shared leadership within an organization you want to be open and humble avoiding becoming that central point of failure.
- The structure you put people into really does influence their behavior. But we also know through a lot of research that the individual matters. Have we found the ways to accelerate our own development of our personal fortitude?
- One of the big encouragements that came out of the study of the 23 people that we interviewed was the importance of this not being something you do on your own. What support might you need to build? And again, feel free to share in the chat.
- A lot of what's really advancing the work across the Dow ecosystem is small teams of like three people. As a small team, or maybe it's as a community, wherever you choose to focus, how centralized or decentralized do you want to be?
- In Dows, it's more like people act as lighthouses to illuminate the landscape. You're really the only person that can decide what that best next step is for you. Practice mojo over ego. Engage in more clarifying conversations within your organization.
- Lisa: Have you seen Holocracy or Sociocracy 3.0 structures being practiced intentionally? Michael: I'm new to Dows and I'm still finding my way. I'm perhaps on the verge of stepping into a more active leadership position. Let's look at what's working well.
- Early on, it's important for the founder to really be active in driving the vision and galvanizing support. From there, what I always recommend to people is taking a good look at who those early founders are. That early group is going to be highly indicative of how things end up sprawling.
- Lisa: Maybe you could give us some perspective on the intersection of leadership and governance. She says you need to be transparent with what exposure people have if they're participating within governance. How do we improve the user experience of people voicing their perspective?
- All right, well, if there is no other questions, we'll wrap it up. It was really wonderful having you on. And yeah, hope to continue the conversation hopefully sometime in the future. Feel free to reach out.
