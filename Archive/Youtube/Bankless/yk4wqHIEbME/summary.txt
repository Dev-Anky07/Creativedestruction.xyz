- Why is everything pumping except for ETH? And what does the grayscale E trust have to do with it? Also a take from me on why I think bull markets are more dangerous than bear markets. And we've got some lessons for ETH holders on how to cope.

- David Wheeler: Why is everything pumping except for ETH right now? Wheeler: Of all games in a casino, craps is probably most like the stock market or the crypto market. In craps, the house always wins, though, right?
- David Wheeler: This is the phase in the market in which players are placing their chips on the table. He says Salana is the clear winner here. Why isn't ETH pumping? Wheeler: It's not new money coming in. It's people that have been around for the bear market.
- When it's bull market time, it is narrative season. Do you think some of this rotates back into Ether, or do you think that is cope? Doesn't this depend very much on what the net new buyers want to actually buy and invest in?
- With a premature launch of the BTC ETF, crypto investors have reconsidered what it means to be on sides. This incoming bull market catalyst is being triggered by external buying pressure coming for the blue chips, Bitcoin and ether. Where is the internal endogenous catalyst for blocks based demand for activity?

- Are we the baddies now? This is the Ethereum community asking the question, are we the Maxis now? Udi Wertheimer writes an entire thread on how to cope with Soul going up as an ETH Maxi. ETH can recover, but you have to earn it.
- David Wheeler: What do you think is our new bitcoin Maxis? Wheeler: Bitcoin maxis are insane people disconnected from reality. He says there's a difference between the crazy zealotry of a bitcoin maximalist and the reasonableness of Ethereum. Wheeler: The sooner you capitulate, the better of a bull cycle you'll actually have.
- David Wheeler: Is Udi right? Does Ethereum have a problem? Or is this just narrative pump? Wheeler: You can't assume things on the 30 to 90 day, okay? You have to zoom out and look at long term trends.
- The whole idea of fading layer twos at this stage, before we've even seen the new set of opportunities and the new ways these will be built out, is silly. If you are thinking that Ethereum is going to outperform every coin in crypto, you are wrong.
- There are two kinds of people. Those that celebrate the success of others and those that can't stand it. Be the former. If you are not Zen as you go through this bull market, your brain is going to be fried by the end of it.
- David Frum: I think the bull market is more dangerous than the bear market. The mistake you're going to make, the most hazardous mistakes, are actually during bull market. He says there are more traps to fall in in a bull market, but you don't have to make these decisions.
- David Weinberger: Have a sell plan. Don't sell everything. Hold on to some things. Remember, crypto isn't a secular bull market. It's like a multi decade bull market, never gone down over the longest amounts of time.
- David Wheeler: Have a home base. rotate those assets into safer things. Record your tax obligations as they're incurred, not at the end of the year. The smarter you feel, the dumber you actually are. Wheeler: Stick around during the bear market.
- There's a bonus tweet for you, David. Don't try to 100 x in one cycle. This is horrible advice. We've get multiple cycles at this thing, so we'll end there.
