[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : You know, I support gambling like, I support drinking. I get that some people can't drink. I get that some people can't gamble. I do get. I've. Look, I've known a lot of people that were addicted to gambling, and it's a crazy addiction because. Did you ever see that Adam Sandler movie?
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:17.000 ] Speaker B : Yes, the Uncut gem.
[ 0:00:17.000 ---> 0:00:18.000 ] Speaker A : Amazing.
[ 0:00:18.000 ---> 0:00:20.000 ] Speaker B : Unbelievably disturbing.
[ 0:00:20.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker A : So good. And such a perfect representation of a gambling addict. They can't fucking. They need that fucking juice. They need it. They need that next bet. Come on. Come on. When they win, they go fucking crazy. I mean, it's a real problem for some people, gambling. They ruin everything in their life. It's a real problem for some people. But I support it because I feel like you need to have control over your life. And if you don't have control of your life, get control of your life. And if gambling is stopping you from having control of your life, don't make gambling illegal. Just. You don't gamble.
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:00:57.000 ] Speaker B : I agree.
[ 0:00:57.000 ---> 0:00:58.000 ] Speaker A : Get your life in order.
[ 0:00:58.000 ---> 0:01:06.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. As an alcoholic drug addict, I'm not mad at drugs and alcohol. I just can't have it.
[ 0:01:06.000 ---> 0:01:14.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Do you think that you could, if you had a different life, could have enjoyed drinking and maybe a little drugs in moderation?
[ 0:01:14.000 ---> 0:01:14.000 ] Speaker B : No.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:16.000 ] Speaker A : You just had that personality.
[ 0:01:16.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker B : I have it in my fucking pedigree, dude. I am thoroughbred on my mom's side of the family. It's every leaf on the tree.
[ 0:01:26.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker A : Wow.
[ 0:01:27.000 ---> 0:01:38.000 ] Speaker B : It didn't skip a generation at all. For my mom, it was like playing Russian roulette with a fucking completely loaded gun.
[ 0:01:38.000 ---> 0:01:42.000 ] Speaker A : Do you think that's nature or nurture? What do you think causes that?
[ 0:01:46.000 ---> 0:02:00.000 ] Speaker B : I think there's a genetic thing, but it's a little bit like, how did the fire start? It's like, who fucking cares? Just deal with. Address the fire.
[ 0:02:00.000 ---> 0:02:08.000 ] Speaker A : Right. But, I mean, is there cases where the whole family is addicted and there's one person that can have a drink with dinner and they're fine?
[ 0:02:08.000 ---> 0:02:21.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, there are, for sure. There's no certainty of it. And more often than not, it will skip generations and it will not be everybody. Just in my case, it was fucking everybody. And gambling was a tHing, too.
[ 0:02:22.000 ---> 0:02:23.000 ] Speaker A : You gambled a lot?
[ 0:02:23.000 ---> 0:02:25.000 ] Speaker B : No, but it's in my family.
[ 0:02:26.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker A : Probably the same thing, right? It's like this obsession.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:04:14.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Dude, it's so crazy how my dad's side of the family is just straight academics, theologians, zoologists, like, just everybody's PhD or clergy men. My dad's dad fought in World War II and was decorated. And then there's my mom's side of the family. It's just addiction, gambling, suicide, like, the whole deal. My mom's father dodged the draft. He was in Canada, like, dodged the draft for World War II and got fairly obnoxiously wealthy selling bootleg gasoline because they had ration for the wartime. And so his bootleg gasoline operation, you could buy as much gas as you wanted, beyond the ration from my mom, my paternal, my maternal grandfather, and he became, like, obnoxiously wealthy, had, like, a boat, like, fucking walked out with a crazy wad of cash, and the fucking dude gambled it all away. And then when he was broke, fucking blew his brains out. Oh, Jesus. I don't know that I ever met that guy. I was a baby when that happened. But it doesn't make any sense because with all the alcoholism, that didn't deter me from becoming an alcoholic, but I did manage to stay away from gambling.
[ 0:04:14.000 ---> 0:04:16.000 ] Speaker A : Wow. 100%.
[ 0:04:18.000 ---> 0:04:52.000 ] Speaker B : The only time I bet in my adult life. I've still never placed a bet in a casino or anything like that. But when I did a brand deal on social media, I got paid to promote some online gambling thing. That was when I showed up at the fight and I was, like, holding up all the cash and I took the photo with you, and that was when I bet on Poirier and McGregor's leg snapped that night.
[ 0:04:52.000 ---> 0:04:53.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, wow.
[ 0:04:54.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker B : That was my first ever bet. I ended up betting, like, a couple of times after that as part of the same deal. As part, like the rest. Yeah, I'm done.
[ 0:05:05.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it definitely makes fights more exciting if you personally have money riding on it, for sure. But if you do have an obsessive, like, I could see how it would transfer. For some people, it transfers to positive stuff. Like, I know a lot of people that were drug addicts that became really fitness were, you know, they start, like, my friend John Joseph, he started doing Iron Man.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker B : Love John Joseph.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:28.000 ] Speaker A : He's great.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:28.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:35.000 ] Speaker A : A lot of people do that. They become marathon runners or workout fiends, and that's their new drug of choice.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:50.000 ] Speaker B : Yep. For me, I think that I'm just obsessed about just doing shit, you know, just accomplishing shit.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:06:36.000 ] Speaker A : Well, that's a good thing to transfer too. I think it's kind of the same gene. The gene that can or whatever it is, I shouldn't say gene. It's the same thing in the mind that gets you obsessed with your next high or your next wild thing. You could also transfer that to accomplishing personal goals and fitness goals and just getting your life together. Starting a business, being obsessed with the business, you can do it in a positive way with that same mindset. And oftentimes you see that with fighters, like some of the best fighters, they had real horrible bouts of alcoholism or drug abuse in their past. Well, he had it while he was at the top.
[ 0:06:36.000 ---> 0:06:36.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:06:36.000 ---> 0:06:56.000 ] Speaker A : It wasn't something that he got over. He actually, it kind of took him down. And what was crazy about him is that while it was all happening, they were filming a documentary, the Smashing Machine, which is really crazy, because they didn't film that documentary with the intent of, of, like, capturing this guy's life falling apart due to drug.
[ 0:06:56.000 ---> 0:06:57.000 ] Speaker B : He was on top of the world.
[ 0:06:57.000 ---> 0:06:58.000 ] Speaker A : He was. Yeah.
[ 0:06:58.000 ---> 0:06:59.000 ] Speaker B : He was murdering everybody.
