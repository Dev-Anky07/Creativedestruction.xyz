- The United Arab Emirates is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All of this was made possible by the wealth the nation has found in oil. But perhaps oil isn't the entire story. The nation has a robust plan in place to transition its economy when the oil runs dry.
- The focus of the Emirates post oil plan is more specifically on attracting business. UAE's plan is that they will be able to establish their major cities as business hubs for the region. If the plan to transition to a global business center does take off, it will pay off far more than any oil reserves ever could.
