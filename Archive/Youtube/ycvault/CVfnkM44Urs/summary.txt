- You. should be on. Can you not hear me? No. Maybe you can ask them to turn it on. Anybody else? Yes. If you have a question about what we covered last time, I am welcome to answer it now.
- How do I identify if a market has a fast growth rate now and also for the next ten years? Just trust your instincts. Think about what you're using more. People your age begin to start using. That will almost certainly be the future.
- How do you deal with Burnout while still being effective and remaining productive? What you do is you just keep going. You rely on people. And founder depression is this serious thing and you need to have support network. Today we're going to talk about how to hire and how to execute.
- The number one cause of early death for startups is co founder blow ups. A good way to meet a co founder is in college. It's better to have no co founder than to have a bad co founder. But it's still bad to be a solo founder.
- At YC, we have this public phrase, and it's relentlessly resourceful. You want a tough and a calm cofounder. Get to know your co founders for a while, ideally years. More people get this right for early hires than they do for cofounders.
- It sucks to have a lot of employees, and you should be proud of how few you can have. At the beginning, you should only hire when you have a desperate need to. The cost of getting an early hire wrong is really high. These hires really matter.
- One thing that founders always underestimate is how hard it is to recruit. If you're going to join a startup, pick a rocket ship. Pick a company that's already working. It can easily take a year to recruit someone.
- A single mediocre hire in the first five will often, in fact, kill a startup. If you compromise and hire someone mediocre, you will always regret it. This is the difference between theory and practice.
- The best source by far for hiring is people that you already know and people that other employees in the company already know. Most great companies in tech have been built by personal referrals for the first at least 100 employees. Another tip is to look outside the valley.
- For most of the early hires you make in a startup, experience doesn't matter very much. Try to work together on a project rather than just doing an interview. Good communication skills tend to correlate really well with hires that work out.
- You should aim to give 10% of the company to the first ten employees. Founders are usually very stingy with equity to employees and very generous to investors. Employees will only add more value over time. The YC companies that have done this well are the most successful ones.
- One thing that founders forget is that after that they hire employees, they have to retain them. Make sure that your employees are happy and feel valued. Learning just a little bit of management skill, which first time CEOs are usually terrible at, goes a long way.
- Firing people is one of the worst parts of running a company. How do you balance firing people fast and making early employees feel secure? Be a team. Work together.
- When should co founders decide on the equity split? You want to set this ideally very soon after you start working together. It should be near equal. Really good people can almost always find some great place in the company.
- Every co founder, you yourself, of course, has to have vesting. If you don't, you have like this dead weight on your equity table. What about co founders that aren't working in the same location? Don't do it.
- Execution for most founders is not the most fun part of starting a company, but it is often the most critical. Everything in a startup gets modeled after the founders. Only executing well is what adds value or what creates value.
- The fifth job of a startup CEO is that setting the execution bar. No one but the CEO can do this. Execution gets divided into two key questions: can you figure out what to do? and two is, can you get it done?
- The trick to great execution is to say no a lot. Most good founders have a small number of overarching goals for the company. Growth and momentum are what a startup lives on. You can't be focused without really great communication.
- The secret to startup success is extreme focus and extreme dedication. A small amount of extra work on the right thing makes a huge difference. The best founders work on things that seem small, but they move really quickly. Indecisiveness is a startup killer.
-  momentum and growth are the lifeblood of startups. When you're not winning, you just have to get momentum back in small wins. One thing that often disrupts momentum and really shouldn't is competitors.
