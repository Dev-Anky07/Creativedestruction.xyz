- David: Jokedao is a platform for contests. What you're doing is minting a voting token so that you can vote on chain on Arbitrum. This year and a big purpose of the show is to get the Arbitram community excited about actually launching DAOs.
- No code smart contract deployment on our site, which is really nice. And also our modular design means that you can deploy a contest and we have other contracts. Now that we're seeing roll ups like Arbitrum come online, you can actually start to use these blockchains as universal computers.
- A contest has been launched on Arbitrum to see what features and projects the community would like to see. Up to 500 people are allowed to submit. The contest is entirely on chain. It's a great way to build chain reputation while also having some impact.
- What is really exciting about the Dow space is composability. All of these different projects can be totally interoperable with each other. The combined impact of that money or that capital or that social capital of that community is far greater than any individual element.
- Joked Out is like bottom up organizing. Guild and juicebox combined with Joked Out provide everything you could need as a group of people to organize and do things together. The idea of non financial Tokens is really exciting to me. I think Tokens can definitely supercharge communities.
- Joke Race is a weekly race that we do. We give joke tokens to people who vote on the winning option. And then about six weeks from now, we're going to do one on Arbitram. Everyone has about six and a half minutes left to submit.
- Six weeks from now, we're going to be doing a joke race around Arbitrum and around favorite Arbitram projects. I just want to highlight for Dows out there looking to make decisions you can use this For Sponsored Contests. That's where it becomes really powerful in really being able to let your community have voice.
- Jokers and Arbitram One will take place six weeks from now. If you follow us on Twitter, you can join our telegram DM us there. We're always glad to collaborate. Thanks so much for having us.
