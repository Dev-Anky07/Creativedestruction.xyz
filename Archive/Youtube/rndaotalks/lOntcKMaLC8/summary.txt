- Max Punk is an overnight celebrity in the venture building world. He did some really fantastic research and he's been gathering some extraordinary momentum. So thank you very much, Max, for joining us and sharing a little bit more about Venture builders.
- A startup studio is an organization which launches companies simultaneously, takes some equity there usually from 20% to 40%, sometimes less, sometimes more, partnering with entrepreneurs. Usually after some period of time or after some milestones, like external fundraising, a company becomes independent.
- Venture studios are actually some places maintained by charity and doing some charitable work to help people who are not able to start companies. There are many problems that studios have and I will go through all of them and then we'll cover also why this model is still very interesting.
- It's very hard to attract experienced co founders to startups, especially if a studio takes 35, 50%, 75% of equity. You cannot attract founders with previous exits. Another problem is, like, you have to have at least one $2 million to start a studio. This can be a red flag for investors to invest in startups.
- Venture Studio Index database shows that startups created in studios usually get to seed funding to series A-B-C from 41% to 51% faster than usual startups. Two third of studios worldwide are inactive studios. There should be more independent studies on this topic to answer it.
- The quality of founders defines the success of a studio. Second time entrepreneurs have much more successful rates than the first time founders. Study shows that top tier VC firms cannot add additional values to top tier one founders. This is an opportunity gap for venture studios.
- What must be the conditions to make it unreasonable for top tier founders not to join a studio? I believe it's very beneficial to become a niche studio and to create a lean approach with your startups. There should be developed some standards to making it easier for external investors and founders to join.
- I'm super curious about cash cow businesses. Could be an ideal strategy for a studio to start by building some sort of cash cow business. Then focus on other things. A lot of agencies dream of doing this, but never seem to make the jump.
- I have two questions. One is regarding kind of governance agreements between founders and the Venture Studio. Every studio is different in their relations with founders. They want to keep the great talent inside.
- Second question was around if you have seen or heard of any examples that are working with kind of symbiotic relationships between the different ventures and the studio itself. Maybe you can share.
- There are two types of people. Some that like jumping across, others that are a lot more dedicated to one track. Does it make sense to have a few specialists that are just doing a specialist thing in one startup? How niche does a niche need to be?
- There is no $1 billion market. Investors will invest in us because it's very, very small. Without this, like becoming a leader in some niche, it's extremely difficult to attract great founders. I don't know how to define how niche does a niche need to be.
- Thank you very much. Max, we're running out of time. Thank you all for coming. We'll definitely check it out.
