[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it's pretty sick. His son tried to give a speech.
[ 0:00:03.000 ---> 0:00:04.000 ] Speaker B : His son is a badass.
[ 0:00:04.000 ---> 0:00:05.000 ] Speaker A : You like Rand? Yeah.
[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:00:06.000 ] Speaker C : Is that the guy who was.
[ 0:00:06.000 ---> 0:00:08.000 ] Speaker B : I like Trump dog goes after.
[ 0:00:09.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that was the guy who's always attacking Fauci. Why did I. Why did.
[ 0:00:12.000 ---> 0:00:17.000 ] Speaker B : He was right. He's attacking him about gain of function research, and they're lying.
[ 0:00:17.000 ---> 0:00:17.000 ] Speaker C : That was shady.
[ 0:00:17.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker A : Why did Trump get him?
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:20.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, why'd Trump get Rand?
[ 0:00:20.000 ---> 0:00:35.000 ] Speaker A : Rand was. It was in a debate and he was like, I haven't gone off after your looks at all. And trust me, there's lot of material there. And Rand Paul was just about. Trump just was like, you're fucking ugly. I haven't made fun of you for being ugly. I could if I wanted to.
[ 0:00:35.000 ---> 0:00:36.000 ] Speaker C : He's not even ugly.
[ 0:00:36.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker A : He's a normal dude.
[ 0:00:38.000 ---> 0:00:44.000 ] Speaker B : To have that kind of confidence with that head of hair is preposterous. Go after people's looks. Yeah, but it was literally wearing a mirage.
[ 0:00:44.000 ---> 0:00:48.000 ] Speaker A : Like, Rand Paul was literally like, right. He didn't know. Stunning.
[ 0:00:48.000 ---> 0:00:53.000 ] Speaker B : Well, I think they would all approach it very differently now. They're probably like, oh, next time I'll get him.
[ 0:00:53.000 ---> 0:00:54.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, they've done it.
[ 0:00:54.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker B : 2024. I'm going to fuck him up.
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:00:59.000 ] Speaker A : No, they've all got nasty in a sound bite debate. They could never come near him.
[ 0:00:59.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker B : No, he's a master performer. He's a guy who's been speaking publicly forever. Forever.
[ 0:01:06.000 ---> 0:01:06.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, and he's mean.
[ 0:01:07.000 ---> 0:01:07.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, he's mean.
[ 0:01:07.000 ---> 0:01:09.000 ] Speaker A : Go on and be like, you're ugly as fuck.
[ 0:01:09.000 ---> 0:01:10.000 ] Speaker B : And he has comedy timing.
[ 0:01:10.000 ---> 0:01:11.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, he does.
[ 0:01:11.000 ---> 0:01:11.000 ] Speaker B : Fuck.
[ 0:01:11.000 ---> 0:01:15.000 ] Speaker A : He'd be in jail. Boom. That was.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:15.000 ] Speaker B : Boom.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:21.000 ] Speaker A : I mean, that was in a debate. And the crowd was, ah, boom. Because you'd be in jail.
[ 0:01:22.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that was pretty. And you see the moment when he thinks of it. His eyebrows kind of wiggle.
[ 0:01:26.000 ---> 0:01:32.000 ] Speaker A : When he got Hillary Clinton. It was when he got Rosie O'Donnell. You could see him because. What's her name?
[ 0:01:32.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker C : Kelly. Megan.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker B : Kelly.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:38.000 ] Speaker A : She's like, Adam, dude. She's like, I got you on this. You've called women this? You've called women this.
[ 0:01:38.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker B : Not all women see him go, yeah.
[ 0:01:41.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker A : And he adjusts the mic. As soon as he knows it, he goes, only Rosie O'Donnell and the place.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:48.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, let's squat.
[ 0:01:48.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker A : There it is.
[ 0:01:51.000 ---> 0:01:52.000 ] Speaker D : And disgusting animals.
[ 0:01:52.000 ---> 0:01:53.000 ] Speaker A : Got it.
[ 0:01:53.000 ---> 0:01:54.000 ] Speaker D : Your Twitter account.
[ 0:01:54.000 ---> 0:01:57.000 ] Speaker A : Only Rosie O'Donnell, for the record, over.
[ 0:01:58.000 ---> 0:01:58.000 ] Speaker C : Destroyed.
[ 0:01:58.000 ---> 0:01:59.000 ] Speaker B : What did she say, though, for the record?
[ 0:01:59.000 ---> 0:02:01.000 ] Speaker D : Well, beyond Rosie O'Donnell.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : Just somebody telling you facts. It's also, shut the fuck up.
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:18.000 ] Speaker B : Super hot lawyer Meghan Kelly. The prototype of the fox of the Babe, blonde, super hot assassin lady.
[ 0:02:18.000 ---> 0:02:19.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, God.
[ 0:02:19.000 ---> 0:02:27.000 ] Speaker B : To me, they're the hottest. They sent her super hot Republican ladies on Fox. They're the hottest alive.
[ 0:02:27.000 ---> 0:02:28.000 ] Speaker A : I went to Mar a Lago.
[ 0:02:28.000 ---> 0:02:28.000 ] Speaker B : So hot.
[ 0:02:28.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker A : I went to Mar a Lago. There was ten of them walking around. They're just around, bro. They're so hot.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:36.000 ] Speaker B : They're the hottest women alive, those Foxbots.
[ 0:02:36.000 ---> 0:02:37.000 ] Speaker C : Foxbots.
[ 0:02:37.000 ---> 0:02:38.000 ] Speaker A : They really are.
[ 0:02:38.000 ---> 0:02:43.000 ] Speaker B : Well, they fucking sit there. I had this whole bit about like, Megyn Kelly is literally wearing a vagina curtain.
[ 0:02:43.000 ---> 0:02:44.000 ] Speaker C : Yes.
[ 0:02:44.000 ---> 0:02:52.000 ] Speaker B : I mean, it's not even a good curtain. Like a blackout curtain you'd have in a theater. It's like the little curtain grandma has over a kitchen window sill where the windows.
[ 0:02:52.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker C : Some of the sun shining through, whispers in the breeze.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:03:03.000 ] Speaker B : Sun's coming and their legs are crossed. I mean, it's a preposterous way of dressing. You have full cleavage. Arms are exposed. There's so much skin.
[ 0:03:03.000 ---> 0:03:04.000 ] Speaker C : Weapon.
[ 0:03:04.000 ---> 0:03:35.000 ] Speaker B : It is wild, though. The attire that women are allowed to wear in certain situations is so sexual in compared to what men wear. Men cover up, suit, a tie. That's a man dressing nice. A woman dressing nice. You can see half of her tits, most of her legs. You see her feet, you see her toes, see her painted little toes, perfect little feet. Damn, Joe. Her long arms, flowing hair, and she's wearing makeup, like full face.
[ 0:03:36.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker A : Let's go.
[ 0:03:38.000 ---> 0:03:40.000 ] Speaker C : Looking at you in the eyes like, I'm mad and you're like, fuck, I've.
[ 0:03:40.000 ---> 0:03:41.000 ] Speaker A : Been so fucking bad.
[ 0:03:41.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker B : Lips. A color that only exists in flowers.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:47.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. Do you ever get into supernormal stimuli?
[ 0:03:47.000 ---> 0:03:48.000 ] Speaker B : What's that?
[ 0:03:48.000 ---> 0:03:51.000 ] Speaker C : How, like, they trick butterflies into dedicating their whole lives.
[ 0:03:51.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. This is all I've ever wanted. We're fucking for seven years. This is the moment, dude. I was wondering how he would do. I knew you were going to do this.
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:10.000 ] Speaker B : He sent me the longest fucking. I was so afraid, like, bummed out that he's asking me to have you come along. And I was like, yeah, for sure.
[ 0:04:10.000 ---> 0:04:10.000 ] Speaker A : I know.
[ 0:04:10.000 ---> 0:04:13.000 ] Speaker B : It was like this long thing.
[ 0:04:13.000 ---> 0:04:13.000 ] Speaker C : No one appreciates.
[ 0:04:13.000 ---> 0:04:14.000 ] Speaker A : It was like eight texts.
[ 0:04:14.000 ---> 0:04:19.000 ] Speaker C : That's what kind of guy he is, dude. Because it is risky. Because you don't know. You'd be like, this motherfucker.
[ 0:04:20.000 ---> 0:04:20.000 ] Speaker B : He knows me.
[ 0:04:21.000 ---> 0:04:36.000 ] Speaker A : I know we're friends, but it's still like, hey, you want me to bring another guy? It's kind of, yeah, I know. Let's go. But I knew in my heart of hearts Matt would rise to the occasion and say things like, have you ever heard of super stimuli? Or whatever bullshit that was, dude.
[ 0:04:36.000 ---> 0:04:36.000 ] Speaker C : No, it's a real.
[ 0:04:36.000 ---> 0:04:37.000 ] Speaker A : I knew it was in there.
[ 0:04:37.000 ---> 0:04:50.000 ] Speaker C : It's fucked up to think about, because you can attract species to. You find what they're innately attracted to, and you produce a version of that that's so pumped up, nature can't reproduce it, and it hijacks your biology.
[ 0:04:50.000 ---> 0:04:51.000 ] Speaker A : Like Doritos.
[ 0:04:51.000 ---> 0:04:52.000 ] Speaker B : Like fake tits?
[ 0:04:52.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker C : Yes, fake tits. Doritos. They would get these butterflies that are, like, the deeper the shade of purple, like some type of butterfly. The males would follow this. They would go to that to mate with the female. They started getting these dark purple construction papers, and these male butterflies would dedicate their whole lives to just, like, floating around this piece of paper, and they'd die. And then human beings were getting hit with the same shit, like flavor blasted goldfish. That's outside of nature's capacity to. Right then you get hooked to the fake thing, and it hijacks your biology, and you're like, I want that sour patch kids.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker A : Corn Doritos. It's over.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:31.000 ] Speaker B : I start eating sour patch kids. I can't stop. I go, just one.
[ 0:05:31.000 ---> 0:05:32.000 ] Speaker D : Just one.
[ 0:05:32.000 ---> 0:05:34.000 ] Speaker A : And the next thing, I eat a whole bag.
[ 0:05:34.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker B : Bag of candy. And I'm sitting there having a fucking diabetes attack.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker C : Dude, if you go into a convenience store, 99% of the shit is bad for you. Yeah, it's bad.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:47.000 ] Speaker B : You can get, like, some beef jerky. It's pretty good. Buy a bottle of water.
[ 0:05:47.000 ---> 0:05:49.000 ] Speaker A : Bottle of water. Beef jerk. You got to buy this.
[ 0:05:49.000 ---> 0:05:50.000 ] Speaker B : Get a cup of coffee.
[ 0:05:50.000 ---> 0:05:52.000 ] Speaker A : Hard boiled eggs that are in, like, a plastic bag at a gas station.
[ 0:05:52.000 ---> 0:05:54.000 ] Speaker C : That's if you got your head on straight.
[ 0:05:54.000 ---> 0:05:58.000 ] Speaker A : The Only person I've seen that. Woodman. No, that's actually a safe bet, dude.
[ 0:05:58.000 ---> 0:06:14.000 ] Speaker B : The hard boiled eggs are pretty good bet. You know why? Because first of all, you can keep eggs for a long time. Eggs you could leave on a counter. They don't go bad. They're encased, right? Yeah. And then when they cook it, once they cook it, it's boiled all the way through, so you don't have to worry about salmonella. Put that bitch in a fucking.
[ 0:06:14.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker A : Not where you're saying. But the societal repercussions of eating it publicly outweigh the nutritional. Dude, I was with a guy who. We were on a road trip. He got in the car and started eating fucking eggs out of a plastic bag in a gas station.
[ 0:06:28.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker B : Me, bro.
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker A : I was like, we're done, dude.
[ 0:06:31.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker B : Hard boiled eggs.
[ 0:06:32.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker A : That's me.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:43.000 ] Speaker B : I would 100% eat that. Not only to eat that, I would be flocked to that, I'd be like, ooh, that's what I'm looking for. Peeled and ready to eat. Perfect. Let's go. I'd eat five of those. Peeled it. What the fuck?
[ 0:06:44.000 ---> 0:06:45.000 ] Speaker A : Somebody else is out of control.
[ 0:06:45.000 ---> 0:06:47.000 ] Speaker B : No preservatives. No preservatives.
[ 0:06:47.000 ---> 0:06:48.000 ] Speaker A : Those are the worst.
[ 0:06:48.000 ---> 0:06:49.000 ] Speaker B : Perfect. You don't have to preserve them.
[ 0:06:49.000 ---> 0:06:52.000 ] Speaker A : Those are the scary ones. You go to a southern, southern gas station.
[ 0:06:52.000 ---> 0:07:02.000 ] Speaker B : I just bought a jug the other day. I went to the gas station. I was at the gas station. They had eggs with jalapenos in them. I was like, oh, spicy boiled eggs. Spicy pickled eggs.
[ 0:07:02.000 ---> 0:07:04.000 ] Speaker C : What are the farts, though?
[ 0:07:04.000 ---> 0:07:04.000 ] Speaker B : Whatever.
[ 0:07:04.000 ---> 0:07:05.000 ] Speaker C : True.
[ 0:07:05.000 ---> 0:07:06.000 ] Speaker B : They're terrible.
[ 0:07:06.000 ---> 0:07:08.000 ] Speaker A : Whatever you want.
[ 0:07:09.000 ---> 0:07:12.000 ] Speaker C : That's exhaust flames, dude. That's absolute exhaust.
[ 0:07:16.000 ---> 0:07:19.000 ] Speaker A : Gas station eggs, that's protein, dude.
[ 0:07:19.000 ---> 0:07:29.000 ] Speaker B : The most terrible farts that I can make are pasta with, like, meat sauce. If I have pasta with, like, sausage with the tomato sauce and a giant sausage getty.
[ 0:07:29.000 ---> 0:07:43.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, hitting. So I'll eat sausage or something before a show. Now I'm drinking bud lights. Now we're going into the show. I'm burping in the front row. It's an hour long show. I'm literally on stage going. I'd see people in the front, like.
