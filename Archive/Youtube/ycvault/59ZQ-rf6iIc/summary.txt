- Last class of how to Start a Startup. List of things that you need to think about as your startup scales. Most of these things for most companies become important between months twelve and 24. These are things that usually hit around 25 people and definitely post Product market fit.
- At the beginning of a company, there is no management. Most companies are structured with everyone reporting to the founder. Clarity and simplicity are the most important things here, but failing to do it is bad. Management structure is not where I would recommend trying to innovate.
- There are four failure cases we see all the time as founders become managers. The first one is being afraid to hire senior people. The second mistake is Hero mode. Third mistake bad delegation. Fourth area is just a personal organization.
- Most important, one of the most important things is performance feedback. In the early days of a startup, people's compensation is whatever they negotiate with the founder. As you grow, it feels hopelessly corporate, but it really is worth putting in place compensation bans.
- One thing that is really important when it comes to HR is equity. You should be giving out a lot of equity to your employees. Get a plan in place for this early. Some mistakes have cost employees or companies tens of millions of dollars.
- When you cross 50 employees, there's a new set of HR rules that you have to comply with. Monitor your team for burnout. This is also a good time to put in place a hiring process. Most founders regret not hiring diversity of perspective on the team earlier on.
- The single word that matters most, I think, to keep the company productive as it grows is alignment. Everyone in the company should know what the roadmap for the next three or six months or a year is. Focus has to always be on great product.
-  FF stock is a special class of stock for founders that the founders can sell in a later round without messing up the common stock valuation. It's also a good time to file provisional patents. If you don't do this at this stage, most people end up regretting it.
- Most companies don't realize where the knobs on their financial model are until far too late. Another thing that is worth hiring earlier that almost no one does is a full time fundraiser. Once things are working, it would be worth thinking about how you set up the tax structure for the company.
- As the company grows, you continue to oscillate. The highs are better, but the lows keep getting worse. Very few founders think long term. Losing focus is another way that founders get off track.
- Once your product is working, switch from not caring about this to caring about it a little bit. The biggest PR hack you can do is to not hire a PR firm. Developing a personal connection with anyone you're trying to do any sort of big deal with is really important.
- One of the Airbnb founders drew this on like a business card or something for another founder that was starting a company. It shows the graph of how adoption goes for a new company. Starting a startup ends up being this very long process. It can be really rewarding. It's definitely long, but it is doable.
- How do you square the divisive diversity being important with earlier speakers saying you want people that are very similar? What we tell people is hire people that you know and that you've worked with before, but try to hire someone that is complementary and aligned towards the same goal.
- How do you do that on a personal level and also on a game, how to keep track productivity systems? I keep one piece of paper with my goals for sort of a three to twelve month time frame. Also keep a list of every person and what they're working on.
- Most startups fail and Silicon Valley almost goes too far in how much it loves failure. If you're failing, first of all, you should tell your investors. You want to shut the company down in a graceful way, help them find jobs.
- Apart from the silicon valley, what do you think are other good places to start a startup? Seattle, La. Lots of places outside the US. I hesitate to make recommendations because I haven't spent enough time in the cities.
- When should the founders think about hiring a professional CEO? Never. Most successful companies in tech are run by their founders for a very long time. If you don't want to be the long term CEO of a company, you probably shouldn't start one.
- Is there a way to get involved with YC before getting funded? No. And intentionally not. What are the most common mistakes to make when you're shifting towards building a great company?
- It's now harder to get into Y companies than getting to Harvard. The two things that we need to see are good founders and a good idea. Has it gotten harder? Has it changed?
- If there's a market that you're excited about but don't know a lot about yet, what should you do? Two schools of thought on this. One is to just jump right in, learn it as you go. The other is to work at a company in the space or do something in the market for a year or two years.
- Right now, seems like you guys have 180 companies a year dumping into the market. Do you think this will create some people will work away from YC? No, definitely not. We have more and more investors saying that half their portfolio is now YC companies.
- When should a group of founders raise a seed fund? It's nice to wait until you have the idea figured out and initial signs of promise before you raise money. If you can wait to raise any outside capital more than 100 or $200,000, you're way better off.
