- Today I am going to be talking about how to go from zero users to many users. A lot of this is based off of mistakes I've made in the past. This is all advice you should take as directionally good guidance. But every business is different.
- When you start a startup, you should basically have lots of time on your hand to concentrate on the startup. For example, if you're in school, it's better to have one or two days straight per week on working on your idea. Being able to really focus and immerse yourself is very, very important.
- One of the biggest mistakes I've made is my co founder and I started a company called pathjoy. It seemed kind of obvious to just create a platform for life coaches and therapists. But when we started using the product ourselves, it was sort of useless to us. Think about this before you even build any product.
- The first thing you should do is think of what the industry that you are getting yourself into. You should really immerse yourself in that industry. The second thing is identifying segments. At the end of the day, in the end game, you've built a business that is using the world.
- Homejoy started out trying to get people to use their book of cleaning at street fairs. One day, the company took advantage of a very hot and humid day and handed out free water. To go from zero to one to three to four, these are kind of things you might have to do.
- Make sure there's a way for people to contact you. What you should be doing is going out to your users and talking with them. This is where you're going to get the best feedback ever for your product.
- The best way to track customer retention is by tracking reviews and ratings. One thing to be wary of is the honesty curve, which is some people will just lie to you. Get to the point where you can do that very fast, because then that's when you get the real meaty stuff.
- You always want to be building fast. There's no point in trying to build features for the point when you have a million users. What you really should do to understand what you should build is to manually do it yourself. And lastly, beware of the Frankenstein approach.
- Three types of growth sticky, viral, and paid growth. sticky growth is trying to get your existing users to come back and pay you more or use you more. viral growth is when people talk about you, then you tell ten other friends they like it. Paid growth is if you happen to have money in the bank. Central theme I'm going to go through is sustainability.
- The second kind of growth is viral growth and like sticky growth you need to also deliver a good experience. How do you build a good referral program? Three main parts: customer touch points, program mechanics and conversion flow.
- The correct way to think about paid growth is that okay, you're going to put money out there, what are you going to get in return? To determine whether that is a good ad or bad ad, all you have to do is CLV minus CAC. And so you actually are earning a profit on it.
- A lot of businesses get in trouble when they start spending beyond their means. It has a lot to do with risk tolerance or risk how much risk you're willing to take on. Payback time is very important. A safe one to go with is three months. Beyond twelve months is very much an unsafe territory.
- Homejoy was literally the 13th idea we fully built out and tried to execute on. The trick here is basically what you really should do is you should have a growth plan when you start out. If you go three or four weeks in a row of no growth, then it's time to pivot.
- There's always a switch over cost. What you really need to do is find the moments where your product or what you're offering is much better or very much differentiated from the existing solution. It's better to just have one or two things that clearly differentiate yourself from a product.
