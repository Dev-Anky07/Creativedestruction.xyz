- Apecoms special counsel debrief number 47. Consider this the library session. A couple of technical difficulties. I'll invite a few of our wonderful apecoms team up here real quickly. If anybody wants to come on up and be on stage and have some conversations.
- Got some questions for the special counsel. This is the one day in the week that the special. counsel comes on up and we do a special council debrief and we ask them. questions. If you as part of the community have questions, raise your hand and ask your question.
- Nice to have you here. Let's quickly go around the horn and say hello to a fellow apcoms, the Hodla collective. Then we'll read our disclaimer, and then we've got some questions for the special council. I'm excited for elections to get started now.
- GM: On point, on track is one of the things we try and do, especially for Wednesdays. We are an informal group of highly motivated and active members of the apecoin community. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin foundation.
- ApeCOms presents Apecoin Special council debrief number 47. Every Wednesday for the last 47 weeks, they have been here answering the questions of the community. So if you got any questions, come on up.
- Aaron: How many times can we use the ape chain title to our advantage? Anytime you can, I would say, is Apecoin dead? Has ape chain rugged? Aaron: Once everybody goes through their stuff, I have a question or two.
- The panel recognizes Aaron as waiting for the special counsel to receive their notes. All right, I figured out a title. So it's apecoin chili chain. It just sounds good.
- The board Chili collaboration with Apecoin Dow for a podcast. It was done yesterday. Probably takes me another five to 8 hours to do, but I think we're expecting it to be live this Saturday.
- Barry: Can you let us know about what you've been working on with the IP and with the trademark? Barry: We do have some, a little bit update may be going to happen, but it's not really finalized yet. But in terms of communication perspective, we will probably see more requests.
- So I'll move on to my other question. Well, I guess you actually already mentioned that you and Wabaum and Jerry had a chance to record and the cat, at least one cat, right? If Jerry was there, there was a couple of cats at least. But will you give us maybe you said cap, Captain Trippy?
- The first series of board Chili podcast is called 100 Hot Ones. The purpose is to interview 100 ape owners, BYC Moic owners, to share who they are. Another episode that need to upload. That one is about made by apes. Stay tuned.
- The next few days is getting all the podcasts live so that we can give the candidates or the nominees some information from special counsel. I think that's going to be very helpful for their running.
- Can anybody put powered by apecoin on their stuff? There is no enforcement right at the end of the day. podcasts are not easy. It takes at least like 10 hours from planning, recording, editing. Even hosting Twitter space is a lot of time.
- I'm here to talk about Chili chain. Like I've always said, I think we need multiple ape chains. We need ape chain networks. I think I'm going to talk to the governance working group again. There's room for improvement.
- I love your podcast, Vera. I almost gave up on creating it because it was just like very time consuming. Someone ran into me in Hong Kong and said why don't you update your podcast? I was like, oh, there are actually a lot some people actually waiting and actually listening. I'll not give up.
- Vaughn: We just want to allow the community that we have this trademark process. As things evolve, I think that's what you're seeing even now. We're trying to make it as easy as possible, but knowing and understanding that this thing is going to evolve.
- SC: Preparing for elections for me and for the other SC members has been like coordinating with the discourse facilitators, the governance working group and the administrators. I've taken a lot of calls with candidates who want to know more about the role.
- SC member: The elections are anybody's game. Clear your schedule and have some fun and enjoy the process. You have to have a message and a vision for the Dow that resonates with the community.
- Whether you win or lose, you're going to gain an incredible experience running for the Dow. The people that you're running against are going to continue to be your colleagues. Don't burn your bridges before they're even built.
- G.T. Bond: It's into your benefit that you network and you get to know everybody around this process. The one thing, it's always you got to chart your path to victory to some sense. Everyone has to have their own strategy.
- Pete: I do hear a lot of conversations regarding voting. A lot of candidates are interested in knowing how my experience is like my running tips. Pete: We created a podcast to answer the basic questions that candidates may have. The answer will be in the podcast, not just from me.
- There was a apefest debrief that you actually got. There was also a little wink a little nod to apecoin art Basel in the notes. Maybe we'll get some alpha sometime soon.
- GM: This week has just been a lot of work. Everybody's popping up during the election season. We love to see who's here now, who's going to be around for the next election. We want to set yourself up for success when you're running.
- Jerry: One of the things that you had in the breakdown was advocating for a more simple language in aips to guide revenue back to the Dow. What does that mean? Do you have any clarifications on that?
- Finalizing strategies to significantly reduce the custodial fees, contributing to financial efficiency. The SC was working on making sure that we're set up for the future. And it ended up being a pretty substantial amount that we were able to save everybody.
- If you have an idea for an aip, just put it up one sentence. More ideas are better and it gets everybody talking, gets everybody thinking. I'm also going to get a conversation going again on shielded voting front to back.
- "What was the third point? " asks Urban Jerry. "I can't tell you the third one yet. Oh, this MFR, it's the fun one, though. It's a big one. "
- Jerry: Go to the people first. The people far outweigh the whales if you get them excited. If you hear critics saying this is just a popularity contest, ask those people to change the world. Focus on the positives.
- This is great circular discussion. I'm ready now to address the hands. Just every week. There's always an hour's worth at least of content in these notes. The information was fantastic and I'm glad that you asked the questions and we got the answers.
- The council is stepping up to simplify agreements and to be intermediaries between the legal counsel who should be counsel and the agreements. AIP should not be held up in the agreement process because the lawyers are trying to be fancy. When the DAO votes for an AIP, the Dow is voting for that.
- When do AIP authors generally get the initial agreement? And at what point does the board step in if there's a disagreement? Aaron would love to ask the board to give me information and let me know what's happening.
- I do have another question. I feel like the board is going to leave, so I don't want to, they are. You can ask your question. Let me just say thank you guys for joining us today.
- AIP 282 spelled out all the current responsibilities of the board. What are your thoughts on where the special counsel should be in terms of, should it go back to the original intent of the founders of the DAO or the legal framework, or are you okay with where it is now?
- Sorry I was a little late. I was on a call with Jerry always just leaving us on cliffhangers. Meme brains, what do you drink? Man, what a broad question. Right now I'm into the ice late with honey. On the alcohol side, I'm a tequila guy.
- How does a special counsel know if they're actually on track or off track with it? Each of those ten bullet points could turn into a full time job description. It's important to make sure that there's clarity going into 2024 on exactly where that priority should be put.
- As an employee, you truly want to have your finger on the pulse of everybody in your organization. With an executive team, sometimes that's a little bit more nuanced with the positions, especially with a startup. There are quite a few things that you do on a regular basis that aren't quantifiable.
- And I think I had seven meetings today since 06:00 this morning. And this goes to the point that we need more organization, in my opinion. And we're trying to put together some kind of like actual organization. I want to do the most good that I possibly can and make the most impact.
- Jerry: I think looking at the special counsel role as something that maybe it's something I end up doing for 2024, depending on how the elections go through. Make sure you give yourself some reasonable expectations on what you want to accomplish on a weekly basis.
- People will buy from people they like. If we want more people to join our club, you want to be more likable. Run on what you believe the future of the Dow should look like. Go after the people.
- Jerry: If people like you, people don't want to see you sell stuff. Authenticity and being a good person is what stands out. Go change the world, then. Change the like. Please.
- The next six months or a year for SE is crucial. SC coming in now and for the next six to twelve months has to be one of those seasoned experts in business. How do we make it clear to candidates that they should be able to run?
- There really aren't a lot of people that are experts in starting and running a dow from the ground up. The best businesses and the most successful people are those who surround themselves with the best people in their jobs. We need to be hiring people that you're describing, not electing people to do all of those jobs.
- G. Raymond: I think the Dow has a growth problem. Do you think voting in someone who's not part of the BYC community can bring more growth into the Dow? That would give me a lot of hope.
- Everybody else. My week was awesome, man. Disney. You guys haven't done Galaxy's edge, bro. Animal kingdom and galaxy's edge. I can go walk around those places. I wish I just had a marathon. Feel free to jump in my dms if you have any questions.
- "I'm in the race, but I'm considering dropping out because I'm not sure if I'm up to it, right? " How much of that is going to get pushed back. Lawyers like to make up rules as they go sometimes, and it's our job to push back. It's definitely not one of the least stressful parts of the job.
- Apecoin is for governance, but the token itself wasn't even launched as like an ERC governance token. My take is that we need to fund actual public goods or software that gets people on him like that. This is the future, every community is going to have their own chain.
- You don't have to be elected for any kind of secretary or metaverse or council position to participate in our dao. There's over 94 proposals that are in progress from the idea stage to the implementation stage. This week looks to allow proposals to go up during the special council election period. You guys have less than 4 hours to get your votes in for this week.
- SSP: Save anything you want to say before we wrap it up. It was great hearing from, I think, most of the special counsel. Let everybody have the opportunity to have the discussion again Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays and noon. See you guys on Friday.
