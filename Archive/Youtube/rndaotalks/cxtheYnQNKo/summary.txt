- Aaron Dao invites Amy Young, ex maker Dao to share some of the lessons from scaling and decentralizing maker. Amy will share a presentation with everyone, the link to it, so you can go on your own time and do research.
- This is ultimately a resource for builders, by builders. I really define dows in the context of an internet native organization. And then the third kind of piece to this is that I focus specifically on this transition process from what I call closed or legacy.
- My research is comprised of these three components. One is about monolithic versus network building. The second is around kind of decentralization. And the third is really like a step by step guide. I'm curious if in this group if either of those resonate more.
- Progressive Decentralization is trying to create change while the system is moving. A lot of the Industrial Revolution thinking comes from streamlining and mass scaling. The Internet has brought us the idea of digital assets and particularly global communities. This is a big opportunity to rethink how we might move forward in this kind of web three paradigm.
- The idea is to democratize production and distribution of information. How can we utilize that access to create more peer to peer checks and balances? At Maker, we have something called collateral onboarding. This builds a bigger kind of bridge between different protocols.
- There's so many layers to decentralization. Maker is an example of a team that wants to be fully, fully decentralized from the technical stack to the organizational stack. Most teams you'll see aren't that interested in this. It's about understanding why you want the community to be involved.
- The Web Three is about optionality. The way that we organize really depends on what we want to build. And this is when you start thinking about what I call multiparty ownership. What we see more today is this idea of multi team or sub Dow.
- Peter Dennett: Decentralization has four stages: bootstrapping, growth, transition, autonomy and then scale. He says growth is how do you bring a community together where they start to define share values together. The biggest focus is that you want to create something that focuses on the successful maintenance.
- The Dow starts to kind of take on its own growth cycle. The teams are mostly working autonomously. Sometimes there's just a lot of first the growth phase when there's a Token distribution. And then last bit is what can go wrong. If anyone has any questions, feel free to raise the hand.
- Edwin: What's the playbook when you're in the bootstrapping phase of a startup? He wants to find all the different kind of best practices or mental models to use when making these early stage decisions. Edwin: There's so many challenges on each of these segments as you're moving forward.
- Seth: We worked together with Source Cred to kind of create sort of a reward system for governance participants. Was that the incentivization of the maker forum for proposals and discussion? Edwin: Sometimes keeping it simple is good.
- Amy: How do you get that initial funding while having the plan of ultimately being as decentralized as we possibly can? She says in the bootstrapping phase, we forget that there's still a lot of space for you to fail. And then you really have to think about token economics of why that makes sense.
- Yeah. If anyone wants to check out the recording of the event, we'll share it in the Twitter and Discord, and we can also continue the conversation there. This is my first time doing this publicly, so appreciate the feedback.
- All right, take care. Have a lovely rest of the day, everyone. Thanks for joining, everybody. Bye.
