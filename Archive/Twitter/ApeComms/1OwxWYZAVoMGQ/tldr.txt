- We are here to talk about Coin Dow's ape chain. Anybody that would like to be part of the discussion or have questions, go ahead and request Lumberg. Let me know if I've missed anybody here.
- The idea around having a separate token to that, does it help or hurt blur? What is blur in that ecosystem without the apecoin Dow backing? I think a successful ape chain can beat that of the blast thing, controversial or not.
- Ape chain will be launching with more than just a proxy to a sig. There are a lot of costs associated with launching a layer two. With blast, my hopes are high and I feel we're going to do well again.
- If you go the AC token route, would you even need an AIP from the Dow. Alternatively, this brings up the whole RFP thing. How are we going to put together a team to even field an RFP?
- The revenue or the inflows for this entire ecosystem is based on the sequencer fees that we can collect. The real job that we have, I think, collectively moving forward, is to create a vibrant chain with a lot of usage.
- The topic here on ape chain. Ape team on the forum. It's closing in two days. Do feel free to drop any more thoughts or questions there on the discourse forum. And then perhaps we'll do another space to address any outstanding questions before post the official AIP proposal.
