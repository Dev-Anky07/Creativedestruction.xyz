[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker A : You imagine if you didn't have to sleep, if there was a pill that they could give you that would eliminate your need for sleep. You would have eight whole more hours to do whatever you want during the day. Like, imagine if you didn't get tired like that.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker B : I don't want that.
[ 0:00:12.000 ---> 0:00:13.000 ] Speaker A : You don't want that?
[ 0:00:13.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker B : No, because what I'm gonna end up doing is, I'm gonna end up doing. There's no way. If I had eight more hours, I wouldn't cheat on my wife. I don't have a wife. But if you gave me eight more hours in a day, dude, that would be. It would be fucking so hard for a guy to get through 16 without fucking, like, doing an eight ball or fucking running around on his leg, shooting us cops. You give him eight more hours.
[ 0:00:37.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker A : Eight more hours. You got to get in the shootout, bro.
[ 0:00:40.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker B : Half the dudes are going to check out. We can't handle it. It's already too hard, man.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker A : Armed robbery. You got to do something, dude.
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:01:07.000 ] Speaker B : Isn't it weird how guys, like, if you look at some of these guys, like Elon Musk, Facebook, what's his name? Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. And then the other guy, they look like aliens, bro. Their bodies white. They're really. Because they work all day, right?
[ 0:01:07.000 ---> 0:01:25.000 ] Speaker A : You look at Elon when he was out on that yacht, those photos, that motherfucker looks like he hasn't seen the sunlight in years. His body has not been exposed to sun. You can't fake that. That whiteness. That's a wild whiteness.
[ 0:01:25.000 ---> 0:01:31.000 ] Speaker B : Well, that's what I'm saying. It's almost an extraterrestrial whiteness. It's the whiteness you see when you see an alien.
[ 0:01:32.000 ---> 0:01:32.000 ] Speaker A : It's paper.
[ 0:01:32.000 ---> 0:01:55.000 ] Speaker B : That's what I'm telling you is that these guys are. I believe that autism is, like, kind of the next. There's kind of a space where there is, like, man and machine, and that's a lot of autism. A lot of autism. You see these guys who. They'll do the calculations, and they'll be able to figure things out. They're almost a little bit more of a computer than a person, or they're somewhere in the middle, kind of like.
[ 0:01:55.000 ---> 0:02:00.000 ] Speaker A : They'Re more advanced than us. They're eliminating the emotions that hold people back.
[ 0:02:00.000 ---> 0:02:11.000 ] Speaker B : That's what they're doing. ANd so when you get that and you get some of these guys that are like that, I think that's kind of the next evolution, and that's closer, really, to aliens, man.
[ 0:02:11.000 ---> 0:02:12.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:02:12.000 ---> 0:02:14.000 ] Speaker B : When you see aliens, they're not like, oh, fuck, man.
[ 0:02:14.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker A : Right.
[ 0:02:15.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker B : Been a long.
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:03:00.000 ] Speaker A : A. That's an interesting thing that I'm doing business, man, is that maybe that's, like, the next level of evolution, is that there's more of a separation between emotional anxiety and all the things, and instead concentrating on calculations, numbers, and accomplishments. I mean, just think about all the different things that Elon does simultaneously. That's what's like, that doesn't seem like a normal human being would have the capacity to develop rockets while he's developing electric cars, while he's developing neuralink, which is like a human computer brain interface, while he's developing the boring company where he's trying to solve traffic problems while.
[ 0:03:00.000 ---> 0:03:01.000 ] Speaker B : He'S in the Mediterranean.
[ 0:03:01.000 ---> 0:03:04.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. With a shirt off, looking like a.
[ 0:03:04.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker B : Sheet, risking it all going crazy out there for 1 minute in the sun. At that level.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:29.000 ] Speaker A : You see, there's a story that came out that said that he's not friends with the guy from Google anymore because he had an affair with his wife. Oh, that's crazy. And then he just tweeted. He goes, it's fucking totally bullshit. He goes, I am friends with the guy. I was just hanging out with him last night, and he's like, I've only seen his wife with other people around, like, two or three times ever.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:30.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, it's all fiction.
[ 0:03:30.000 ---> 0:03:32.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. He goes, I haven't seen her in years.
[ 0:03:32.000 ---> 0:03:32.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, that's fiction.
[ 0:03:32.000 ---> 0:03:49.000 ] Speaker A : Like, he tweeted about it. He's like, this is just a lie. Like, they just make up lies. People just make up shit about him. Imagine if you just made shit up about you and then printed it in the fucking. What was it in? Was it in the wash? Was it in the Wall Street Journal? Wall Street Journal.
[ 0:03:49.000 ---> 0:04:06.000 ] Speaker B : But isn't that, I mean, now it's like there's bots making stories. So soon I feel like there's going to be a story for everything that's going to be out there, and people are just going to be. Is there even any real, what recourse do you even have these days?
[ 0:04:07.000 ---> 0:05:03.000 ] Speaker A : Well, he could definitely sue. A story like that is defamatory. But all they have to do is say that they have a source. But, I mean, you got to check with him, I think, before you print something like that. But the thing is, the concern is that what those stories do. I think he made some sort of reference to short sellers. Okay, so, like, someone who's, like, shorting the could say, you could make an argument that if the stock crashes, that you could make a lot of money on that. And if you made a story that made Elon look like he's out of control, he's losing his mind. People go, oh, boy, I'm going to get rid of my stock because this CEO was out of his fucking mind. And then you're shorting the stock, and so then the stock crashes, and then the people that shorted the stock wind up making a shitload of money. You could make an argument that someone would write, I'm not saying they did, but someone would write a defamatory story just so that they could profit.
