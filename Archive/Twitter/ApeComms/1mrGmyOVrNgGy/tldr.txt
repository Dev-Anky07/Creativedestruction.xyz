- All of our authors coming in to join us for the AIP roundup this week. We've got election season coverage kicked off and going on throughout the community. We are going to focus on the AIps today as we do on Mondays. Happy to invite the community to ask questions.
- Before we go to Aaron, I forgot we let profits up on the stage as well. Good morning to profits. She's got crazy events going on this week. Make sure you guys are tapping in. It looks like there's some apecoin activities going on at this event.
- We plan on announcing the mint, so we expect people to come. This game is going to be quite a lot of fun. We feel that the gaming narrative is pretty ripe right now. An important part of marketing is baking in the proper incentive systems.
- We need a smaller suit for profits. We need a suit that's made for the Miami Heat for profits as well. That other one wasn't going to cut it in any season in Miami. Let's get some more suits. Apecoin will be highly represented. Maybe I'll wear a suit.
- Aaron: We're asking the Dow to pay $1.5 million to have an exclusive deal with a game that is sort of untested. If it doesn't go through, would you resubmit with a smaller ask? Aaron: I'm happy to answer any questions about it.
- Don't forget to get your votes in. Get till Wednesday at 06:00 p. m. PST. I got another song stacked up. We're getting out of here.
