- Once the richest country in all of Latin America, Venezuela is now home to the greatest economic downturn for a single country in modern times. The country has the largest oil deposits in the world but squandered it. A lot has been said about the political issues surrounding the downfall of Venezuela. But in this video, we will just focus on the fundamental economics behind Venezuela's unprecedented rise and its devastating fall.
- The government of Venezuela was throwing money around the economy pretty aimlessly. This also stifled a lot of free enterprise in Venezuela. The declining oil price then brought the whole house of cards crashing down. This quickly turned from quantitative easing into straight up hyperinflation.
- The story of Venezuela doesn't sound too dissimilar from the story of Norway's oil boom. Norway used its oil wealth for social welfare, the same as Venezuela. Any economic entity relying on a single source of income is in a potentially precarious situation.
