I don't really know how to source 300 people to get them out to a solar site for a year, but I absolutely know how to ship a couple of shipping containers full of robotic equipment out there to build the site. No matter how we're automating the solar industry, a key primitive that we're going to end up needing is this stuff mover, this robot that can move things from point A to point B on the solar site. And so that's actually what we built towards the end of last year and beginning of this year, is a giant robotic forklift. And that's kind of what I want to talk to you guys about today's.
