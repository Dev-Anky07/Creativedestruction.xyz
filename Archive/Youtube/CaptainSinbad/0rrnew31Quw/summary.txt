- Ruben Carter was wrongly accused of triple homicide in the mid 1960s. It took 19 years and two trials to overturn that verdict. Carter refused to surrender the freedoms that were innately his. He left prison not only a free and innocent man, but a better and improved one.
- Reading about Ruben Carter's story made me reflect on my own obstacles, my own obstructions. Treat them as if they don't affect us. Inattention is the greatest revenge. For those of us willing to concentrate our energies in the right direction, greatness is coming.
