- Paige Omara: We're the team that helps our portfolio companies hire for this event. We'll do three tech talks. And then we will have two quick pitches to hear about other companies. Then we'll initiate breakout rooms.
- Electric airplane industry and in particular energy storage. Most of the carbon footprint of the aerospace industry is airplanes larger than 100 passengers. Propulsion essentially being ultra lightweight engines, energy storage, ultra lightweight ways to store electricity.
- Two different technologies that have been mostly in development are energy carrier technologies. aluminum air fuel cells or other metal air chemistries and hydrogen fuel cells. There's a lot of money going into the space and major opportunities to revolutionize the US aerospace industry.
- How are your relationships with the Doe and the Air Force established? How does an engine compare to engines used for smaller planes like that were used for firefighting? Catapults or ramps or other things I think have a big opportunity.
- About 4% of our power in the US. Comes from solar, and by 2050, it's going to be about half. The problem is that labor is actually the key bottleneck preventing solar adoption right now. Charge Robotics builds robots that build large scale solar farms.
- The first system that I want to talk about as the hydraulic system in the vehicle. That's the steering and the brake. We ended up 3D printing a bunch of different pieces and then buying an off the shelf motor and motor controller and gearbox to control the steering. This is actually what we shipped to our first pilot deployment.
- The next systems that we automated that I wanted to talk about today. I don't know if it's a zoom window or something, but it's blocking part of your slide. I'll just minimize that. Cool.
- Charge robotics is building a portable robotic factory to assemble solar modules on a solar site. The company is currently hiring mechanical engineers for the project. Here's a video of the early days of Charge robotics.
- For the most part, these sites are quite flat, just sort of by design. What type of control theory are you using? PID, baby. All day, every day. As we kind of advance our technology, we're almost certainly going to be using some more advanced stuff.
- Labor is something like 30% of the project cost. Of that mechanical installation is about half of that. This labor shortage is big enough right now that we don't really need to charge less than human contractors charge. Also curious who your first customers would be and why.
- Our complete system will require dramatically fewer people than conventional labor today. A single one of our systems can do the work of something like several dozen people. Every vehicle that you see on these sites is diesel powered. How long does the forklift last per charge?
- The module installation step is the most labor intensive part of the entire project. Are you considering making an electric model? Right now, we're mostly not focused on building construction equipment. If you're interested in working on this, feel free to shoot me an email.
- Oliver from Impossible Mining is building underwater robot vehicles which collect battery metals from the seabed. And we're doing it in a way that really doesn't harm the ecosystem that lives down on the sea floor. We'd love to have you come and join us and deliver this vision of making it easier for everyone to drive an EV.
- How deep is the machine able to go? These nodules only form in areas of water that have been that for millions of years. Typical depths are about 5000 to 6000 meters. How environmentally, economically viable is this versus others?
- We will do about 3 million metric tons in a year. That will generate about 2 billion in revenue. Who owns the rights to the minerals? There are two jurisdictions. How long are you out to sea? How much material do you harvest per haul?
- Mujimeet develops a scalable 3D printing process to produce whole cuts at mass production level. We hire a large variety of backgrounds, from electrical engineers to bioengineers to food scientists. If you have any of these profiles or are just generally interested in our mission, I'm happy to get in touch with you.
- We print with more than 250 nozles per printing hat. We can do the material switch within each nozzle up to 50 times per seconds. This enables much more precise structures and textures.
- Josh Santos, the co founder and CEO of Noya and Noia converts existing cooling towers into carbon vacuums. His machine consists of a few key components that we are developing entirely in house. If you're interested in cooling towers or carbon capture, let's talk.
- The cooling tower with our equipment retrofitted is designed to be able to perform up to 95% or more of its peak cooling capacity. We actually store CO2 in a gaseous form. It's regenerated as a gas. We then compress into liquid and we store that in a big tank.
