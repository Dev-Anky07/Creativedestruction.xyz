- Today is just a combo space with the Apecoms crew and the ladies of Buc crew. Should we bring up the Marcons people up first and set up the know? Lorelord Peak, Lore Popple, Snowflake, and Toby, please request. Markoms has less nominations, candidates, and might be easier to fill.
- Apecons and ladies of BYC are an informal group of highly motivated and active members of the Apecoin community. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion. We are not here to advocate for any aips or nominees. Just providing a channel to share information within our community.
- SSP has five minutes to give us a rundown of what the Markom's role is. Adventurous and tiger have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting behind the scenes coordinating this. If you can go ahead and invite the rest of your networks, like repost, say GM or GN, bookmark this.
- All our marketing communications nominees are up on stage except for Lindstro. I'll be happy to quickly do a five minute rundown of the marketing communications working group charter and mandate. Let's go.
- The marketing communications working group was voted in in June, July of this year. The goal is to set up the infrastructure for and empowering the community to deliver sometime in 2024. If there's any questions, I'm in the background.
- The elections for the first round of votes for marketing comms and metaverse stewards just went live tonight. We're doing the election for the secondary citizen. Secondary apes of the ones, not the first class special council members. Tiger and adventure put an agenda together for us and we got some questions.
- Today we are going to intro the marketing comms nominees first. You each will have two minutes to make a quick introduction of your just background and your bio. Popple, Snowflake and Toby. This is the order we'll go.
- I'm running for the Marco and Stewart role. My vision is to create a narrative for the apecoin Dow. I really live and breathe blockchain. Please go and vote for me.
- Poppy is the ex committee manager at open scene. Also the founder of a boy tea. Wants to support make by a and boyip into the ecosystem into the development. Snowflake, your two minutes please.
- Snowflake is a certified technician both by Apple and Microsoft. Toby is an artist in VR three D and other art. I really want to expand across the regions and help everybody. We have our last nominee coming up.
- My background is in more in operations and project management. But growing up, I've always been into the creatives and the arts. Currently I handle operations, special projects and the socials of boring security. I'm just really a community person who loves to get to know.
- If you'd like to just share in your comments, like some of the great campaign pieces you've been sharing, just drop in the comments. Marketing and comms can too. But if you can double time your speaking and doing that, but we'll give you guys a chance to also do that later.
- So now we're going to go into the questions loss. Are you able to just briefly read through all the questions. Then each nominee will have five minutes to summarize some of these points. If one of them is too difficult, just let us know and we'll probably give you a pass.
- What inspired you to run for marketing and communications steward along with what is your vision? How do you plan to make sure that the Apecoin Dao mark Homs is more inclusive. What social media platform would you utilize to promote the Dao and grow its presence?
- Nominees have five minutes to give us a vision of what their platform would be. Lorlord: My vision is three people attacking the job description at three different levels. Tiger: I believe that it should be gamified rather than scrapped and redone. Machu: This is actually my dream job.
- Is it peak Lord or Peck Lord? Please. Tiger, you have five minutes to go through the questions listed. And please tell us a little bit about your.
- Lorelord: I truly believe in the power of the effective communication. My goal is to empower our community and try to create with this Dow a beacon. The budget is a really tricky question because at the end it's something new for us if we are part of this Dow.
- "I want to bring that skill set to the Acon Dao to improve the IP ecosystem for Acon as well. I really want to link up more make by a to create more partnership and also on both different layers as new user to help improve with the AIP " "I hope I'm in here for all this brand and also for the budget "
- Snowflake, please, it's your turn. You do have five minutes. I'll try to fit eight questions into this. Once again my hand will be kind of waving when you hit that 32nd mark. Go ahead.
- So what's inspired me to run for marketing and communications? languages are crucial. I speak more than four languages, so that's helpful. What I do miss is some french speaking person, that would be awesome.
- Only invite those who develop on apecoin with an apecoin and bring the expertise regardless of the chain. Social media. Everything that is not web free endemic. How would you ensure the VG is effective and accountable?
- Toby's vision for apecoin is for it to get the attention and spotlight that it deserves. More content published online, not just about the price, but about the culture within the DAO. The first two months will be very critical where we're going to be building the 2024 plan.
- The budget would be less than 1% of our holdings. Most companies do 25% of the revenue they have. Where the, the most community support is going to be needed is getting that budget passed 100%.
-  APt 246 is the working group charter for marketing and communications. You have the entire week up until next Wednesday, 06:00 p. m. PST, to get your votes in for any of these nominees. After that, five will carry on to become candidates in a final election.
- And thank you, SSP for joining us. I know it's late. Everything I say is just to make sure you guys are still awake out here. I'll stick around, but I might be sleeping. Good night.
- What is AIP 245? We can go to the forum. You can also search and that to bring up the working group charter for the metaverse. I'm not going to go too much into it, but bad teeth is there.
- Wabam is one of the members of the Apecoin special council. The mandate is to facilitate apecoin adoption in the metaverse beyond the other side. Wabam asks the marketing and comms nominees to step down and go into listener so we can bring up the Metaverse nominees.
- There are some really amazing people running to be a steward of this metaverse working group. The mandate would be to support content creators and builders on the other side, facilitate ape adoption in other metaverses. Of all the working groups proposed to date, this one has the most scope for being creative and innovative.
- There's a list of initiatives it says these initiatives include but are not limited to. Some of those initiatives, I can tell you aren't happening now. Like the improbable miniverse dive bar. So you've got to work with what you have.
- Working group can focus on gaming integrations, on gaming partnerships, on how do we get ape out there more. I think both of those things really should be priorities of this working group, but it's going to depend on who gets elected. Working groups are independent, autonomous entities.
- And with that, we want to welcome you guys up here. I saw David down in the audience as well. Send us a request. We'll get you up here with us. Thank you, tiger and aa.
- Board sad Fez ape. I chose the name on May 1, 2021. It's a long name, but it's, I guess. All right, so you can call the board set.
- I'm a founder and CEO of a local insuretech here in Istanbul. I really believe in the metawars. It's going to be a really big business. The priority for this working group should be fully support what is going to come out of the other side and make it the metaverse of metaverses.
- Marketing and communications stewards are the folks that we expect to be professionals at marketing and communications. Sometimes being a leader means hiring people to know when things are not necessarily your expertise. We will ask these questions just a little bit differently than we did in the previous round. And we will still just keep that five minute timer.
- Sad Fez Ape: I'm really excited to be a part of the emerging metaverses. I feel that we have the opportunity to fully impact what's coming up as the other side. I will be working with the work group members to cooperate on a strategy. We should make it as a success for the success of the community.
- What type of initiatives do you hope to support? I know you spoke about collaborating sort of directly with Yuga and they are one of the launch partners for the token. But I think the priority should be experiment within the other side first to fully support.
- My definition of metaverse is everything other than in real life. We are already there, but it will emerge, it will change in nature. This is just going to grow as other side and as the ape community. We should definitely be the ones who define how it's going to move forward.
- What is your vision for the metaverse working group? Let's meet up in real life. I can organize something in Istanbul. It should focus on the other side first, and then we will move on.
- How would you imagine putting a team together to support this vision? And how do you imagine supporting them in executing the vision? We'll definitely reach out to the ape community first.
- What makes the metaverse working group worth being funded by the Dow? It will depend on the initiatives. Let's create ideas, devise plans and then ask for funding. If the ape community, the Dow believes that it is useful, it will get funded. If not, so we'll iterate more.
- How would you ensure that the group stays effective and accountable? I believe we should have a regular schedule of meetings and meeting minutes and then share it with the community. The transparency is important, what we are doing.
- Tiger Woods: How much longer do we have after that funky sound? You don't even pay attention, man. Okay, so we went a little over there for a second. Once again, when I'm waving, that's kind of the 32nd mark. We got to close that up.
- We had David, but I think he's having some trouble connecting right now. If he's able to join us, we'll try to add him last. In the meantime, g is us. Greetings from Vancouver to everybody.
- What inspired you to run for the stewardship of the metaverse working group? My passion for creating immersive worlds, really, that's my background in motion pictures. We've got a bunch of questions and we're keeping it to five minutes.
- The metaverse is an interconnected universe of virtual spaces where physical and digital realms merge. It includes digital, or, sorry, dynamic user driven environments, augmented reality, immersive spaces. emphasis is on creating metaverse experiences that not only enrich user interaction, but strategically contribute to raising the value of the apecoin token.
- Apecoin could be a front runner in the metaverse space or the cultural token. Well considered initiatives and projects that contribute to the growth and sustained value of the apecoin token make it a strategic investment for the Dow.
- What sort of a budget do you think is going to be needed here for the metaverse working group? $1 million? Well, no, I wouldn't get into specifics. But I would propose a flexible budget. Initially, let's allocate resources for foundational infrastructure.
- What sort of initiatives do you hope to support? Well, I think it's a digital universe. I would say, again, focusing on the builder tool layers. The charter needs revisiting, and then I would do that as part of a discussion.
- Next on the list, I think we have David. He was second on our original list. Let's get David in here with us. What I will do in the coming future, I will focusing on appcoin mass adoption.
- Well, shoot. Tiger, I feel like he wants you to do this interview. Have I been summoned? That's totally fine. We got to grant it. We do it for the people. Right.
- What kind of budget do you think is needed to pursue this vision? Should think over how to allocate our budget to anyone who will build our metaverse for our epcot. How to charge front list is a bigger question.
- How would you ensure that the working group is effective and accountable? Everything is new that we need to try to figure it out in the coming future. Most important thing is that for working group, we could put enough time on building this kind of thing because it's new.
- David: What is your definition of a metaverse, and what does it include? I think metaverse is something that in the coming future, is a combination of social fi and gamefi. I hope you have safe traveling.
- Next on the list. We have, sorry, we have snowflake backup, and I'm going to pass this back to you. Who's up next then it's Snowflake. We're going to let adventures take over for the rest of these interviews.
- What inspired you to run for Metaverse steward? There were some developments in VR that I really loved. What if we put the ape coin in the middle? Let's do something like this. I'm super happy about this sponsorship from the apecoin.
- Snowflake, you only asked me one question. You asked all the questions the other guys. We were all limited by five minutes. Let's move on to our next guest.
- So unfortunately, we do have to go on to the next guest let's see, we have on our list TFG. If you don't mind, I could just run through it. AdventureSafe is doing the rest of these interviews or I'm fired.
- Michael Padilla is the founder and CEO of a championship esports and gaming entertainment company called Congana. Has over a decade of professional experience in the gaming and web three industries. Will lead and develop the apecoin, Dow's creator program. Will focus on bringing revenue to the Dow.
- Apecoin Dow needs to be a premier power player in the metaverse and gaming worlds. What makes the Metaverse working group worth being funded? Check out my AIP or not my nomination post. Vote for me.
- What inspired you to run for Metaverse steward? I really want to focus on our content creators. When it first goes live, it's going to be easy to create content there. I'm taking a different route than TFG.
- We need to have smart metrics. We need to create measured goals. The metaverse is going to be a huge place. We really need to whittle it down at first and see how we can get more attention to the Dow itself. And I think that if you set the correct goals, that the voters will speak for themselves.
- Do you have goals in mind that you would set? Of course. I think our first initiative is to definitely put out a statement on what we're actually doing for the DAO and how we're going to help the Dow. Goal number two, the outreach starts.
- All right, so what do you think makes this metaverse a working group worth being funded by the DAO? I just think that the metaverse is truly a change in how we view the world. What budget do you Think is needed to see through this vision?
- We have our last guest today, our last nominee. He is also going by Metasailer. Will ask you a few questions. Do you want to just do a quick, I think this might be your first space speaking with the rest of the Dow.
- I am a computer scientist, a founder, an investor, and also a board member of apecoin. We're very excited to bring Asia to the table for building global metaverse spaces. Having a store where Apecoin starts being relevant at the biggest gaming level is how we're going to drive adoption.
- We are going to shorten your questionnaire a little bit to about three minutes and 30 seconds. We're going to let adventurous ask you some of the questions. Thank you so much.
- What inspired you to run for Metaverse steward? Definitely. We hope to make this kind of the circulating metaverse asset class between all of the different creators that are out there. And I think that Apecoin has the potential.
- Max: How do you execute this vision? You need people, and then you need a plan. How do we run a bank that's regulated by the central bank Hong Kong? How would you ensure that the working group is held accountable?
- Each category has two seats available as of today. Round one is weighted, meaning per wallet. Final five will become candidates and move on to the second round where it's one wallet per vote. One of my favorite things whenever these elections happen is hearing how global our community truly is.
- SSP: We are going to invite the governance and the special council members up for stage time when it's their turn. There are also aips up for vote. We're going to be announcing some stuff this week in support of the election coverage. See you in the morning.
