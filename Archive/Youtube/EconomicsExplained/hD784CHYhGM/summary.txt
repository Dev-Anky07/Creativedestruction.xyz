- There is a measure in economics called labor productivity. Workers today are amongst the hardest worked individuals in history, while simultaneously being the most efficient. Does people working longer and harder make for a more prosperous economy?
- Work is very important both on an individual level in the sense that it provides income to maintain a quality of life. Also on a national level because it provides the amenities that we in the modern world have come to expect. Here we have entered the age of entitlement.
- World War II put a lot of pressure on people to work more and more. The average working hours of the average full time worker has never been as low as they were in the later half of the 1930s. We have ultimately become a society that is obsessed with same day shipping, 24 hours, opening times.
- Most roles in the modern world should be based on output and results rather than time in a chair. It gives people the opportunity for entrepreneurship. If you really wanted to fight the good fight, consider setting aside a day per week like Sunday where you don't buy anything.
