[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:58.000 ] Speaker A : There are seven patents on chemical compounds for marijuana right now. The people who stand to make the most out of marijuana legalization are pharmaceutical companies. That's why they make. That's not true. Well, it is if you look at the biggest supplement company because you own by the same pharmaceutical company, but you can't patent the one that work. Yes, you can. They patented seven. Seven strains of GM chemicals. No, no. Seven active chemical compounds in pot that have been patented as drugs. If pot is recognized, there is no one who would stand to more than pharmaceutical companies by providing it as medicine. Not necessarily true. If people allowed to. Maybe it's not necessarily true, I'll give you that. But I also think it's not necessarily true that the reason people can't smoke up is because Big Pharma is sitting know Martin Schreckley going, oh, let's make potty illegal. There's absolutely. Pharmaceutical companies have done the same thing. It was revealed in the WikiLeaks memos. See, this is where I was saying, don't interrupt, you fuck. Where Hillary Clinton said that she's against marijuana in every sense of word. Right. You remember those trumpets that came out? Yeah. Is he. He said he would leave it up to the States. That's actually a constitutional approach.
