- A small core dev living in the layer two world. I have been working on looking at layer two coming from a layer one background. The goal of this talk is just to get everyone as bullish about layer two as possible.
- I want to talk about layer one and layer two trade off. How does layer one supercharge layer two and then a little bit of forward thinking what I think layer two will become in the next few years. This journey hopefully illustrates how I spend my time.
- To break Ethereum, you probably need a lot of money. On the other side, you have just node. But the downside of that is that it's very expensive because we want maximum decentralization. And hopefully this will become easier in the years to come.
- Instead of a validator, you have sequencer and you have proposer. They're fundamentally very different by actors. When we move to the decentralized sequencing scheme, we're likely going to see an encryption and decryption community.
-  layer two should not copy layer one. I think layer one will supercharge layer two in three different areas scalability, security, decentralization. And I will show you why.
- There is something called a faster confirmation rule because right now Ethereum is finalized every 6.4 minutes. This will essentially speed up the layer one to layer two message. The other one is layer one on chain Censorship Oracle that Ad and a few other have been thinking.
- New structure will allow to reduce the state size when you run a node. Running a layer two node will become a lot more accessible. To me, layer two is this is probably the golden age of layer two. I want feedback on what can the layer do more to support you guys.
