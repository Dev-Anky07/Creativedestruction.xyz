- In college, Paul did physics, did physics at Cambridge. Paid for college doing online marketing, direct response marketing. Started with SEO in the 1990s. When Google launched AdWords, that's when he really started to learn how to do online marketing.
- What does great product lead to customers? And what do you need those customers to do? Spread the word. Retention is the single most important thing for growth. Focus on getting product market fit, because in the end, idea is execution.
- Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have successful businesses. Figuring out what Facebook's retention rate is is not a hard problem. So retention is the single most important thing for growth.
- It's not clear to everybody what the most important thing is for a company. Registrations don't matter unless they become long term active users. How do you drive towards the magic moment that gets people hooked on your service?
- The last area here is tactics. What typically happens in silicon valley is everyone thinks marketers are useless. Build it, and they will come. I don't believe that's true. I believe you actually have to work.
- Facebook started off as college only, so every college that it was launched in was knocking down a barrier. Building for where the world is today is an easy mistake to make. We're now at 104 languages translated by Facebook for Facebook 80. 70 of those are translated by the community. These tactics are quite interesting.
- There's a great book whoops the book on the right here by? Adam Pennenberg. Viral Loop goes through a bunch of case studies of companies that have grown through viral marketing. I strongly encourage you, if you're interested in viral marketing, to get that book.
- Think about virality for a product in terms of three things. First is payload. How many people can you hit with any given viral blast? Second is conversion rate. Third is frequency, payload frequency and conversion rate, whatever that would have.
- With virality, you want people who sign up to your site to import their contacts. You want to then get them to send an invite to all of those contacts. Only do this after you have a large number of people retained on your product per person who signs up.
- On SEO, there are three things you need to think about. Do your keyword research, figure out which keywords you want to rank for. Next most important thing is links. Get valuable links from high authority websites for you to rank in Google.
- Email is dead for people under 25 in my opinion, right? Young people don't use email. The most effective email you can do is notifications. It's a question of open rate, click through rate. Everyone focuses towards doing marketing emails that are just spam.
- A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow. If you can be hungry for growth, if you fight and die for every extra user, you will grow faster. And I strongly encourage you to do that.
