- ApeComS Special Counsel Debrief number 47. Consider this the library session. A couple of technical difficulties. I'll invite a few of our wonderful Apecoms team up here real quickly. If anybody wants to come on up and be on stage and have some conversations.
- Jerry: One of the things that you had in the breakdown was advocating for a more simple language in AIPs to guide revenue back to the Dow. What does that mean? Do you have any clarifications on that?
- Finalizing strategies to significantly reduce the custodial fees, contributing to financial efficiency. The SC was working on making sure that we're set up for the future. And it ended up being a pretty substantial amount that we were able to save everybody.
- If you have an idea for an AIP, just put it up one sentence. More ideas are better and it gets everybody talking, gets everybody thinking. I believe that we needed to move in a direction of delegations and empowering people.
- And I'm also going to get a conversation going again on shielded voting front to back. I don't want anybody knowing who the hell I'm voting for in the next election. People should be able to vote with their hearts and how they feel like they should vote.
- For today, adventure. Save anything you want to say before we wrap it up. Let everybody have the opportunity to have the discussion again Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays and noon and get your votes in today. If you guys have questions, you DM me. Happy to answer questions.
