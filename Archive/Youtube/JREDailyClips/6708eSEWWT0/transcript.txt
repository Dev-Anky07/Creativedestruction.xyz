[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker A : This is a huge controversy in science at the moment. We know that there was enormous flooding 12,800 years ago, but the question is, what, what caused it? Why did it, why did it happen there? And, and there's a very powerful theory, which is now backed by, by more than a hundred mainstream scientists, that, that the Earth passed through the debris stream of a disintegrating comet. And that theory is called the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. And those several bits of that disintegrating comet might have been pretty big, maybe up to a kilometer in diameter, and they landed on the North American ice cap, generating huge amounts of heat. Tremendous shockwave hits the ice cap and it turns that ice into water and it rushes down southwards, fills up these lakes, overflows these lakes, and tears up the landscape underneath it. And this younger Dryas packed hypothesis is, by far, in my view, the best explanation of what's going on.
