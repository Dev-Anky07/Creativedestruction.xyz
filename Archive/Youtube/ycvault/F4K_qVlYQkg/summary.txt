- Jawbone plays in this world of what everyone's talking about now is the Internet of things. We think the thinking needs to shift from being less about the actual things to being about the individual user. When you have things on your Body 24/7, they become this kind of perfect context engine for everything in the world around you.
- In the exploration phase, we start to validate some of our concepts. Then we actually start to build a product, launch it, and then iterate. Hackathons are a big part of it. A lot of it is driven by Demo Fridays.
- And this is now when the responsibility shifts from the R D folks to what we call Product Experience team. There's a lot of innovation and creativity now in the actual implementation of how we're going to build and create a product. That's where the roadmap starts to get fleshed out.
- Jawbone's strategy starts with what we call kind of our category strategy. Our view was, look, all of your content and media experiences are now in your phone. And then we said that experience need to be seamless across time and space. An experience framework becomes essentially a brief for your engineering team.
- There's a lot of layers to user research, right? We ask different kinds of questions. You sort of have to separate what are questions that are going to help make you smarter about your thesis. No one's going to tell you what to build. And so you're the one who's making that decision.
- Uptwear 24 is a wireless product for health tracking. The idea is to help people understand more about themselves. The tracking part is really fundamentally about the hardware too. And then the third part is act. So track, understand, and act.
- Each design feature is not mutually exclusive. How do you approach it holistically while solving problems? If a startup wants to build a system, eventually, should it start focusing on one small thing?
- There is a grand unified vision for us, and we look at different categories. Different categories have different dynamics. They move at different paces, they have different replacement cycles. How do they think about so you got to think about your category.
- When you iterate on a certain product, how does your process necessarily change. How do you take into account information you might have learned from, let's say like 24. We have the ability to sort of go back and forth and skip over steps as necessary.
- We're about 500 people and we have a very remote set up. We've got an office in Sunnyvale, headquarters in San Francisco, office in Seattle, Shanghai, Pittsburgh, London. The single biggest thing that we continue to always try to get better at is that communication.
- We're in 56 countries globally, 100,000 points of sale. Some of it's deliberate and planned, some of it takes time and again, it's part of know, we want to be here. And then a lot of it is also opportunistic, right?
- Sam mentioned one early we'll try to run a hardware company like a software company. There's no model for what we're trying to do. It's never been done before. We're putting together disciplines that have never had to work side by side to create experiences.
