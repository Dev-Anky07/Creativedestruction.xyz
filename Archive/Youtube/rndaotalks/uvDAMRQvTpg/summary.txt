- Brian Robertson is the founder of Holocracy. He has been involved in the crypto space as an investor for nine years. This is the first time he's publicly spoken about this, so that's kind of cool.
- Holocracy came from a lot of experimentation and I ran a software company back in 2001. It's a highly structured system, but a decentralized structure. People often get the wrong idea that without a top down management hierarchy, decisions must be made by large groups. Holocracy uses more structure, not less.
- Many decisions are not best made by a vote of token holders. Democracy is a terrible way to make many many decisions. But there are things that need more individual decision making to lead effectively in an organization. Whatever design decisions you make often become both strengths and weaknesses.
- The idea of strategy in Holocracy is usually left as something that perhaps a role can treat it. Could you tell us a little bit more about how that strategy process works? Or this idea of what does a strategy mean in a Holocracy context?
- Every role needs strategy. The same could be said for leadership. Holocracy distributes and infuses strategy and leadership throughout the system. But there are downsides of running a company with a conventional top down management hierarchy.
- Holocracy has a default and a way to change that default. Who decides which role fit each participant? There are very, very few decisions that make sense to make via any kind of voting mechanism. What Holocracy has is couplings.
- Most decisions are centralized in a decentralized way. Most decisions are made by one person, but it's a different person for different decisions. The goal of Holocracy is not to be decentralized. It's a means to an end.
- The biggest mindset shift was when you start to distribute this authority. The goal is not to get everything right up front. Most things we can trust our ability to evolve towards as long as we have an evolutionary process to get there.
- Dows, like, basic financial protocols are just really well fit for the Dao model. And they work really well for that problem set. You need a certain community trust for people to build on top of a protocol. Maybe with these we can start to make some inroads into integrating the two.
- Holocracy uses a fractal structure. Every team is governing itself. It's governing its own micro processes. And then that team becomes a part of a larger team. This makes it very scalable and the largest we've seen an entire organization doing Holocracy. But it has nothing to say about how to get community involvement.
- In Dows, ownership is a very abstract concept. It relates to control, it relates to the right to leverage the benefits or usage of the thing. Holocracy ends up being somewhat of a neutral system, independent of the ownership structure.
- Holocracy is compatible with whatever ownership structure you want to plug into it. I personally find it really useful when equity is more distributed, more decentralized. There's also some interesting things you can do with legal structure. Where can we learn more about these different Holocracy legal structures?
- Holocracy itself is kind of centralized ownership in my company. What we're doing is creating a foundation that's going to hold this core IP and provide some of the functions. But there's still functions here that don't lend themselves well to democratic decision making. We're creating a Dow Holocracy hybrid.
- Is the system in general is self evolving, self transforming and so on. Given enough time and conditions, it will hopefully get to a good place. How do we start to create these set of rules?
- Holocracy is a constitutional rule set and it is version controlled. We reorganize the constitution into five articles which are independent of each other. This gives you an incremental path to adopting Holocracy. In Dows, the philosophy around the design of smart contracts is following a similar approach.
- If you're interested in following along our process of launching this Dao Holocracy hybrid, you can find more about Holocracy on our website. We will definitely be announcing this once we have something there that is ready to share.
