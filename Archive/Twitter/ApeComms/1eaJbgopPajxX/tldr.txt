- For special counsel, should they be purely a board? I believe that special counsel are the face of the Tao. We should be looking know what have been the greatest value creators in our past century. Have KPIs, have goals, have things that you are going towards.
- Machi: Do you think that the metric that we should be tracking is the amount of apecoin or the value of that that is in our treasury? Would love to hear your thoughts on that. If we had to buckle down for one year, hold the treasury strong, earn some kind of yield on it.
- The metric to track within the Dow is actually the value created in the Dow. Why are the startups the one that create the most value? It's because they're creating positive change so fast. It makes sense for Apecoin to think of itself in that startup mindset.
- All right, that's it. You got a rugged rate at 420, baby. If you're on time, you're late. Teach you everything and show you everything. You, sir. Bye.
