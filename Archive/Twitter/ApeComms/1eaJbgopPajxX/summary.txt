- SSP: How do I sound today? SSP. It sounds strong, but it does sound, like, a little bit gruff. Are you coming down with a cold? Maybe I need to turn something up. Do I sound better?
- We're going to move right into these discussions. Sound out of my RODECaster that I really wanted better on my phone. Let's get some more people up here. Just don't drown out some of our guests.
- It's nonstop spaces. Just Jesus in the mocha halls, machi in the machi halls, papill with the board and in community. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion. Not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. Just providing the channel to share the information with the community.
- Three proposals up for vote this week. Apecoin Dow AIP ambassador and mentorship program. Reallocation of Ecosystem Fund into Ethereum and USDC AIP 355. SSP, if you see something and you want to talk about it, retweet it.
- We have again the three AIPS 344, 354 and 355. We'll do the summaries and then get into the discussions with the authors. If you guys want to join us, please do. Or just drop your questions in the comment box.
- Proposal aims to create 13 hand sculpted apecoin and yugo related art pieces for promotional use at live events. Cost is 88,555 apecoin. Some places already have agreed to display these pieces over the next six months to one year after the proposal would be approved.
- AIP 355 proposes reallocating 10% of the Apecoin Dow's available fund into 5% of Ether and 5% USDC. The funds would be utilized for different activities related to operating the Dow. The author also requests that the administration does their best to aid in facilitating the sale OTC over the counter.
- AllCity governance. Stewart been around the Dow for a while, written a bunch of successful AIPS. Program will take successful AIP authors and pair them with first time applicants. Aim is to help push those proposals forward that need a little help.
- If you want to ask a question, jump up here with us. I'm just looking at the steps to implement and the timeline as I do when asking questions. And if anybody else wants to jump in, just being mindful that AC may jump at any time.
- So you've got week one to two as drafting guidelines and finalizing an AIP scoring template. There's seven sections on the AIP draft template, but only three are shown on snapshot. Looking to kind of provide a proof of concept back to the Dow when the program concludes.
- How are you planning to pick some of the approved authors to coordinate with you other than those who reach out. I think involving the community as best as we possibly can is always the move lost. Major congratulations to everyone on the Apecoms team who's been around for so long.
- After this three month period, are you looking to submit another proposal? Are you looking for this to have funding? Do you have any broad thoughts on where this might go after that first three months?
- Will this sit inside the Governance Working Group as an ongoing service to the Dow? Is this something that would also fall into a thank Ape concept? All options are open. I would love to see this become part of our next budget.
- This was actually born out of a thankape idea a thon. I would love to work with thankape. The marketing behind it so much fun. If nobody else has any questions, we'll go to Victor and his AIP 344.
- All City, did you want to give any closing statements here regarding your proposal? Again, it's yours is AIP 354. If you guys haven't voted, you have till Wednesday 06:00 p. m. PST. Use your voice and vote whether you got one.
- Proposal is to onboard new members into the Dow beyond web three. First is captivating people's attentions through art, which is the art pieces that would be done. Idea is to have a QR code which would bring them into a short video about the Dow.
- The ones you see on the pictures are pieces from Menchaka Studio. I have worked with them to make one of the Apes you See on The Proposal. Dart Studio uses this strategy to first use shopping centers and then go into private galleries and then to museums.
- Aaron: What Victor is talking about is already done. You can scan something and it can bring people to. Aaron: We need pictures. I have need we got to get you to post them. Post the pictures.
- After two years, the ownership would transition at no cost to the Dao through a future Dao AIP. Can you explain a little bit, please, about what's going to be behind that QR code and how you're going to create that content?
- Victor: These things could be multipurposed and become assets of the Dao that could be used variously. One thing is that creating storytelling through metaverse experience. The more that I can create that suspension of disbelief and the engagement.
- More than half of the pieces would be the apecoin logo in different versions. The pieces will be able to be disassembled so they're easy to transport. The whole idea of the proposal is to get new members into it. I think more cool art for the ape coin dow will really get our message out there.
- Six different Apecoin schools would be artistically different. Have you thought about tokenizing the if if someone in the gallery scanned the sculpture, they could get an NFT and a miniature sculpture by way of payment with Apecoins?
- All right. You got any thoughts, any ideas with this proposal? I know AA was a little bit busy today. Anything else before we look at moving on? No, I think this is good. Good discussion, good feedback from the community. Thanks so much.
- GMGM: You sound all out of energy. You're dying on us. By order of the special counsel, I'm going to write an AIP. Are you hooked up to an Ox cord, or are you on Bluetooth?
- AIP 355. Just tell me. when it works. Tell me when it doesn't. We're not going to go too crazy, but I don't want to hear any more hate about my microphone.
- Sword AIP is the reallocation of ecosystem funds into ethereum and USDC. Although it doesn't look like it will pass as is, we've got some valuable feedback from it. There's some merit with every piece of feedback you heard.
- Sword: There's some merit to this proposal, but what I'm hearing is timing is wrong. This would be better put forward by a bunch of people than one, two, three or four. It's a larger conversation that needs to be had in the ecosystem eventually.
- SSP: There is just a lot of discretion here for the foundation. It's definitely something that, again, a group would better tackle than an individual. Nothing I can think of other than if I were to present it again.
- If you guys haven't voted yet, you've got until Wednesday at 06:00 p. m. PST to get your votes in. Otherwise we've got plenty of posts up. We're going to be reaching out to so many of you over the next week or so to coordinate another stage to meet you. At some point we'll have to read the facts.
- There are many people in the community who don't agree with what the role is or what it's become. If you wanted to change it, you've got to put a proposal up. We're going to do it Wednesday. Lost is going to read 29 bullet points of facts from the Ape Foundation.
- Updates on Forum admin's Account we would like to introduce the Apecoin admin account ape admin. This account has been created by Webslinger to deliver transparent communication between the foundation and the APecoin community. It is not hard to find what the responsibilities of the Special Counsel are currently.
- Lust: My only suggestion would be, yeah, go ahead and read them. Record the spaces so we can all listen to it at, like, double speed or something. If it's okay with you guys to really understand your single issue candidacy.
- SSP is literally the Kanye West candidate in the special counsel election. While the facts of 29 bullet points of a job description might be there, that's not the perception from the vast majority of the community. Now I think it's time to kind of help remove that confusion.
- Aaron: I hate disagreeing with SSP. The whole point of AIPS is to have the Dao come to a consensus on different issues. Having marketing and comms come in and simplify the message of what the council does is a very realistic goal. I would love to work with you on the special council if both of us get elected.
- Aaron: Messaging, narrative, the communications has been an issue in the Apecoin Dow for the longest time. If you are elected, I run with you. Then we have that. It's an actual AIP that puts the board, in my opinion, where it belongs.
- Special counsel has to be very careful that they don't fulfill the Howie test in the US. Planning for sustainability of Ape foundations and Apecoin Dows operational expenses. I just think that it needs to be read under the umbrella of Stewardship and oversight.
- 10% of the eight point treasury. It's really late. Wish he understood how the Dow worked earlier. Do it on the blockchain. Easy. It could open the doors, though, to them making those decisions. A more fleshed out version is probably the way to go.
- We're having a discussion right now about the role of the apecoin special council. Do you guys have any thoughts about the special counsel other than get rid of them? The board, aid council members that go in there got to do everything.
- So, again, if you come into this special Counsel role, it's called special for a reason. Means you're going to do everything. I will vote to try to change our Dow in a way where it's more automated. Just send me your votes, guys.
- Machi is getting so many delegated votes. Remove your big 6 million. Just use the delegated. See how many stand behind you. Is there a way to budget a small amount for community projects and stuff next year?
- The community is sick of the old guard, and they want new stuff. The current councilors have improved light years over the ones before. Because those expectations are set, we're expecting even more from the future council members. We want you guys to overachieve and beat the last council members more for less.
- The grant agreement process is maybe even more arduous than the actual process itself. More important even than clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the special counsel. If we could change the perspective, that would be huge.
- SSP: I look at the special counsel as the board for regulatory reasons. Would it make sense for a treasury working group to manage our treasury? Absolutely. This is not a case about creating roles. It's about how do you create opportunities and lanes for other people in the community.
- It says proactively exploring and identifying opportunities for the apecoin dow fostering growth and advancement in line with the Dow strategic goals. We'll have the conversation with special counsel on Wednesday and I do want to hear from Helena.
- SSP: I believe that special counsel, whether it should be a certain way or not, in reality, they are the face of the Tao. In my eyes, it really should be, as we mentioned, diverse. We should be looking at the greatest value creators in our past century.
- The metric to track within the dow is actually the value created in the dow. If you choose even a slightly adjacent metric and you go for that, try to maximize that, it could lead to completely different results. Apecoin dow has equal or quite comparable visibility to Nouns dow.
- I do want those automations and then the other part about startups and KPIs and bring value back. But right now in the bear market or the beginning of a bull or where we are today, I don't want to see powered by Apecoin proposals. My votes won't go that way.
- So please, when you guys are writing your AIP, do consider, and I have seen people recently, another $2 million ask. Smaller checks, I think quarter million comfortable. Anything higher, half million. Don't be afraid to jump in and have a discussion here.
- Startups within the Dao, whether they're working groups or little projects or businesses. You're going to look at them as startups. But the Dow in general, we have to be really mindful about the regulatory environment. We do have startup infrastructure that we can be building and funding.
- Apecoin is looking to give value back to the Dow. The company is in the idea stage of developing a grant program. They are looking to connect with the community in the next couple of weeks to discuss it.
- My biggest concern going into Special Counsel and if I do get elected in is something that I have to tackle head on. What do we really want to see as those KPIs? And I feel like we need to get really clear on what it is moving forward.
- There's less than 1% participation across our 141,000 unique wallet. Participation, alignment of authors, passing of AIPS, overall value and sustainability. For me, the only KPI that really matters is what is the price of Apecoin in a year's time.
- 40% of approved AIPS are still being negotiated during the grant agreement negotiation process. If you automated the process more and kind of like just follow what nouns Dow is doing for their proposal process, I think that would increase efficiency.
- The legal and admins do not get to adjust any terms in the AIP. Some grants have decided to add terms that were never part of the mean. Are we really involving legal in every single AIP?
- My question was thanks for you raising the elephant in the room. Like why did SSP shift and go into as special counsel. I want to see Machi going at SSP and that could be something we can all enjoy.
- My question is AA adventures ape mentioned Howie test. And I want to know how real is this danger and do we need to separate the special counsel? G, do you want to give a response on this one?
- The regulatory environment is just very I don't know even know how to phrase it. There's just no real right and wrong way to do things. The line is gray. I think just navigating that gray line is people who are able to do that and still push the Dow forward.
- Working on Ape chain a little bit, putting it and what did I do? It is so illegal. I think any grant agreement going forward will be a lot easier after mine goes through. Make these agreements more amicable and friendly toward these grantees.
- Fenwick is known as also the less conservative they really are. They really want to support what we're doing around the Apecoin Dow. Adventurous wasn't necessarily talking about being fearful of AIPS. The board needs to be separate.
- An executive team of sorts, which is coming up through the Dao similar to your A team for Ape chain. We don't want Special Counsel to say, hey, this is the best ApeChain. We want them to go back to being just what they need to be.
- SSP: The responsibilities, as they're currently written, don't reflect true board responsibilities. He says if the intent is to get Special Counsel to truly a board, we've also got to rewrite what those responsibilities are. SSP: It's not going to happen right away, but the right timing is now.
- There's a conflation between what it is to be a dow versus a group of Ape Coin supporters. In terms of how governance works on chain, that's the reality. What I'm suggesting is, yes, we need to think about what is this going to look like long term.
- All the special council members that are trying to run right now throw up an AIP. We want to see how creative you could be, how well you can write and see how good your ideas are. If you've never written a AIP and you're ready for special counsel, vote them down.
- Special Counsel, they represent the foundation. One of the things that we are working on is trying to automate the system. There's this group called the Governance Working Group and they have a little bit more freedom to implement some of these things. We would like to work with devs from the community to help push this project through.
- Apecoin hasn't been labeled as security. Some of the other tokens that might be like the metaverse ones have been labeled securities. Uzi says you just need to be aware of the environment. Be careful. They're going to put you back in the news.
- There was, like, five more things he did first, at least, and only more. He's only continued to do more things. I think Haman has had their hand up now for also saying thank you. Please go ahead.
- Using pre approved proposals and collateralized proposals so that someone can request a proposal in advance and before they actually go through and build something. This is a way to potentially increase the amount of proposals the Dao can fulfill without increasing the risk.
- Machi said write an AIP if you're a special council member. Legal counsel should not be able to change the terms of the AIP after it has been voted on. Apecoin Foundation is a decentralized, autonomous organization. Terms should be passed when it goes through.
- There should be some standardization. The community also has proposals in the works and discussion in progress addressing some of these things. To me, the Dow space is about how are we going to govern ourselves in the next 300 years. I do get really excited in finding and empowering the other people that want to keep building.
- SSP: I don't think we need to have more and more roles and responsibilities for special counsel. Join the community, join the discussion. Put proposals up and let me read these. Getting the board back to where it goes will open up lanes to go down this road.
- SSP: The Special Counsel sometimes might assist in the grant agreement process. When they step in during that process, it might come across as scope creep. How are we addressing problems like that going forward?
- To your question about what if this passes, do I ride off the sunset? Well, not at all. I want to empower and open up lanes for the entire community to come through with their ideas. I think this is the whole point that I'm trying to make about decentralized autonomous organizations.
- The job description and the website with regards to the roles and responsibilities for SC are contradictory. It does say though they are not limited to the items listed below. So I see this as very much the capabilities that you need to have as an SC candidate.
- Captain G: I worry about when someone talks about a very sort of high level role, which may call for maybe, you know, a non seasoned operator to know a board director or SC. So does that in any way put us in jeopardy? And do we need to get lawyers?
- G: There are going to be things that you're going to have to be mindful of in terms of covering yourself and covering you and your team. The way I wrote that charter with Ads was it would follow the same track as the Governor's Working Group. If you're thinking of setting up Dow LLC in the Marshall Islands, this is not legal advice.
- All right, it's 07:00 p. m. somewhere, so I'm sure people are out of here. I keep trying to get you up here, but I know your thing was messing up earlier. Maybe he's up here. All right, well, let's hear from Big Bull if we can, and then we'll wrap it up.
- SSP impromptu discussion about the apecoin board. The Apecoin Special Council token. Because Ape Chain. There was discussion about a token. Who's going to do all the AIPS? Are all board members the same?
- There are only three proposals live this week. You got till Wednesday 06:00 P.m. PST to get your votes in for these. This is part of why the working group structure was established. The community could have some of these responsibilities.
- Well, you guys approved Dave coms and we got to take advantage of our time here. SSP wants to run for Special Counsel. We're going to make him do Markoms anyway. This is personal SSP. It's personal.
- Paul: Will there be some other areas of responsibilities? More than likely, yes. But does it mean it's just going to be the working groups? Not necessarily. We're expecting the community to do it, which is the whole goal of decentralized autonomous organizations.
- "It's been a long day. We've got opportunities jumping out of the forest at us. Opportunities for better information. Got our proposal approved. We're going to figure it out, make it happen maybe " More information to come.
