[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker A : Northern Europe and North America were absolutely inhospitable wildernesses during the Ice Age. They were frozen, they were dry, and they were dangerous, and they were not the places that people would go. People naturally gravitated south towards the equator, towards the tropics. That's where I would expect to find traces of a lost civilization, and that's where I do find traces of a lost civilization. You don't really find. I've never reported anything about the UK, for example, in my books. We have stonehenge, we have Avery, we have these stone circles, but they're not old enough. That was the time when the UK started to get warmer. And it's the same with the rest of Northern Europe, and it's the same with the northern part of North America. You have to go down to the southern part of North America, you have to go into Mexico, you have to go into South America to really find an environment during the Ice Age that would have nurtured a high civilization.
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker B : And there's a lot of speculation as to why they weren't able to cross the Bering landmass, too. Right.
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:02:10.000 ] Speaker A : Again, this is an area where there has been a narrative that archaeology has sought to impose upon us. And this was called the Clovis first idea, that there was a people who archaeologists called the Clovis people, we don't know what they called themselves in North America. And traces of their characteristic tools, particular sort of fluted points, arrowhead spear points, turn up from about 13,400 years ago and end abruptly 12,800 years ago. And for a long time, with the beginning of the younger Dryas, and for a long time, archaeology maintained that this Clovis culture, so called Clovis culture, we don't know what they called themselves, were the first Americans, and that there were no human beings in the Americas before 13,400 years ago. And bit by bit, the new evidence has come in which has forced archaeologists screaming and tearing out their hair to back away from the Clovis first paradigm and admit that actually, yes, there were people here before that, but even then, they're reluctant to go very far back. We've recently had these footprints in white sands in New Mexico, 23,000 years old or so. That's largely being accepted now, but there are much earlier dates. There's 130,000 years ago from the Ceruti Mastodon site near San Diego.
[ 0:02:10.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker B : That's the one that's being disputed because they say it could have been rocks that crushed the bones, made them that way.
[ 0:02:15.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. What I see, again is an unfortunate mindset where a new and interesting idea is proposed, supported by masses of evidence and published in Nature. Nature has a pretty high bar to what it accepts. And then the critics look for any way to get rid of it.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:36.000 ] Speaker B : Can I stop you here? Are you aware of the boneyard in Alaska?
[ 0:02:36.000 ---> 0:02:40.000 ] Speaker A : I've heard of it and it sounds fascinating. I don't think he's revealed much about that.
[ 0:02:40.000 ---> 0:03:28.000 ] Speaker B : Well, it's an amazing discovery. This guy's a gold miner and he has this large piece of land in Alaska. They're mining for gold and they start finding, like, tusks and bones. And in one area that's only a few acres, they found thousands and thousands of woolly mammoth bones and tusks. And Sabertooth Tiger. Was it Sabertooth tiger? No, was short faced bear. They found all these, like, all the megafauna, many animals that weren't even supposed to exist in Alaska. And he's like, look, we have the bones of it. And one of the things they found recently was bones that were sawed, clearly sawed human workmanship, but like a sophisticated tool. Let me see if you could pull it up so you could see how it looked.
[ 0:03:28.000 ---> 0:03:29.000 ] Speaker A : Clearly cut.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:30.000 ] Speaker B : Isn't that amazing?
[ 0:03:31.000 ---> 0:03:31.000 ] Speaker A : Absolutely.
[ 0:03:32.000 ---> 0:03:35.000 ] Speaker B : So they're trying to find out what the dates on these are.
[ 0:03:35.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker A : That was my next question. Have they dated it?
[ 0:03:37.000 ---> 0:03:49.000 ] Speaker B : They just got these recently. This is fairly recent. So I believe he's had some issues with universities not giving back his stuff and selling off his stuff.
[ 0:03:49.000 ---> 0:03:49.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, dear.
[ 0:03:49.000 ---> 0:04:28.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Well, he recently started a bone rush in the East river, because it turns out that during the 1920s or 1930s, stuff that they had taken from his land before he owned it, they had dumped some of it because they had so much of it. They dumped it in the East river and they were balking at it. But meanwhile, these people have found it there. So here it goes. I think many of you are intrigued by these ice age bones found in the boneyard, Alaska. If you zoom in, you'll see that it's been sanded or somehow been worked down to a smooth finish on the end. I'm going to carbon date one of them and post the results when I do. So, this was three weeks ago, so it's probably going to take a little longer, but look how smooth it is.
[ 0:04:29.000 ---> 0:04:42.000 ] Speaker A : Perfectly cut. And we'll look forward to seeing the dating results. But the fact that we're dealing with megafauna that went extinct between 12,000, 811,600 years ago implies very strongly that it's at least that old.
[ 0:04:42.000 ---> 0:05:01.000 ] Speaker B : Not only that, his area has a very thick layer of carbon that seems to indicate some sort of a mass burn or some sort of a horrible disaster. So they're going through these layers of things and they're finding an unbelievable amount of animals that died in this area. Just a mass die out.
[ 0:05:01.000 ---> 0:05:04.000 ] Speaker A : Yes. And what would cause a mass die out? Not human hunting.
[ 0:05:05.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:05:05.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker A : I'm strongly opposed to what they call the overkill hypothesis. This is one of the alternative explanations for why the megafauna went extinct at that time.
[ 0:05:14.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:05:14.000 ---> 0:05:36.000 ] Speaker A : Is that huntergatherers literally wiped out all the megafauna. And to me, for a couple of reasons, that doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense, first of all, because hunter gatherers we know in the world today do not wipe out their prey animals. They live in coexistence with them, they live in balance with them. They don't just destroy them all. It's our kind of culture that destroys animals.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:37.000 ] Speaker B : Right. Like what we did with the bison.
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker A : What we did with the bison, yeah. And therefore it seems very unhunter gatherer like activity to completely destroy the megafauna. And the other thing is the simultaneous extinction of large numbers of creatures. That it's happening very quickly suggests to me that we're looking at a disaster of some sort. And that's why the younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is solid science, although undoubtedly disputed, which suggests that multiple fragments of a disintegrating comet hit the Earth 12,800 years ago. Many of them didn't hit the Earth. Many of them exploded in the sky. They were not that big, maybe 100 meters in diameter. So they were air bursts, but they leave these characteristic signatures in the ground.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:21.000 ] Speaker B : Like Tanguska.
[ 0:06:21.000 ---> 0:07:49.000 ] Speaker A : Exactly like Tonguska. The Tonguska event is a recent example of that. 30 June 1908 happens to be at the peak of the beta torrids. And the torrid meteor stream is identified as the likely culprit for what happened in the younger dryers. Wildfires burning. You get these impacts smashing into the Earth, bursting in the air over forests, they cause huge fires, and that's why you get enormous amounts of charcoal as a result. And then the larger objects, it's thought, hit the North American ice cap and caused a very large amount of melt water to flow into the world ocean. And that's what brought temperatures down at the beginning of the younger dryers. We can argue there are alternative theories. Maybe solar activity was involved. Robert Shock prefers a change in solar activity, and kudos to Robert. He's a brilliant scientist and he's put his neck on the line by advocating a much older Sphinx. Any scientist these days in the field of archaeology who sticks his neck out and says that the archaeological narrative is wrong immediately gets massively attacked and I think, unfortunate. A couple of points I'd like to make about this. First of all, we said at the beginning, most archaeology, certainly in the industrialized countries, is a result of a dam or a road being built, an archaeologist being called in to see if there's anything there. It's not a targeted search. It's kind of random. Something's happening, and archaeologists go in there.
