[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:02.000 ] Speaker A : Um, we're up.
[ 0:00:02.000 ---> 0:00:04.000 ] Speaker B : What's happening, my brother?
[ 0:00:04.000 ---> 0:00:05.000 ] Speaker A : I'm hanging out.
[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker B : Dude, you look fucking great. I told you that when I saw you, but I want to tell you on air, you look fucking great, man. You said you lost 60.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:14.000 ] Speaker A : Like, 60. I was, like, 240. Now I'm like, 185.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker B : That's amazing.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : Yes, sir.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:18.000 ] Speaker B : And you did it just by cutting out soda?
[ 0:00:18.000 ---> 0:00:32.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I know a lot of shows. Yeah, like, shows. Soda. Soda's so bad. It's so bad. It's so bad. But it's so good. I'll have a soda. I'm a bad boy, and I'll have a monster energy. But Celsius is so good, too. Have you had one of those?
[ 0:00:32.000 ---> 0:00:43.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I have. They're good. It's so bad. The key to those things is just every now and then, that's the know. Every now and then, you reward yourself with a. Ah, this is nice.
[ 0:00:43.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker A : On these hot Texas days. I've been here. We did Dallas two days yesterday, back to back yesterday and the night before.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:00:53.000 ] Speaker B : I'm coming. See you tomorrow night.
[ 0:00:53.000 ---> 0:00:54.000 ] Speaker A : Let's go.
[ 0:00:54.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker B : I'm coming to.
[ 0:00:57.000 ---> 0:01:09.000 ] Speaker A : Did we. Did you buy? Yeah. Oh, Joe, you didn't have to do that, because if you said we hooked you up, I said, what the hell? I didn't. But since you said you buy. Thank you so much for coming.
[ 0:01:09.000 ---> 0:01:12.000 ] Speaker B : My pleasure, my pleasure. I'm excited. Me too. I'm excited, man.
[ 0:01:12.000 ---> 0:01:24.000 ] Speaker A : But, yeah. Especially out in this heat, dude, just like, you know what? I had a great show. You know what? I'm feeling a little bit naughty. I'm going to have myself cocon ice. Yeah. So good.
[ 0:01:25.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker B : Reward yourself. The problem is when people do it all day, every day.
[ 0:01:28.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:01:28.000 ---> 0:01:45.000 ] Speaker B : That's when it's just your body doesn't know what to do with that kind of sugar because it's so unnatural. Your body never gets sugar like that. In the wild, you get sugar and fruit. When you have, like, a glass of sugar water, it's just pouring right into your bloodstream. Your body's like, what the fuck is this?
[ 0:01:45.000 ---> 0:01:46.000 ] Speaker A : I like Guarana.
[ 0:01:46.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker B : Ooh, that's good stuff.
[ 0:01:48.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker A : That is crazy.
[ 0:01:50.000 ---> 0:01:50.000 ] Speaker B : I don't.
[ 0:01:50.000 ---> 0:01:52.000 ] Speaker A : It's naturally caffeinated or something.
[ 0:01:53.000 ---> 0:02:00.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, the berries. Crazy. Yeah, that's acai. That's the same thing as when you get an acai bowl. That's guarana. That's the berries, man.
[ 0:02:00.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : I remember going to Brazil the first time, and I was like, oh, this soda is so good. And also, I was, like, bouncing off the wall, fucking like.
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:17.000 ] Speaker B : I'm like, oh, my God. Dude, I feel crazy right now. It's delicious. What is that called? Guarana. What is the name of that? Soda?
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:02:19.000 ] Speaker A : And they have a sugar one by Antarctica.
[ 0:02:19.000 ---> 0:02:20.000 ] Speaker B : Is that what it is?
[ 0:02:20.000 ---> 0:02:23.000 ] Speaker A : I think it's an Antarctica brand. Not from Antarctica.
[ 0:02:23.000 ---> 0:02:24.000 ] Speaker B : Super legit.
[ 0:02:24.000 ---> 0:02:24.000 ] Speaker A : I love.
[ 0:02:24.000 ---> 0:02:26.000 ] Speaker B : They know how to eat over there, too.
[ 0:02:26.000 ---> 0:02:26.000 ] Speaker A : In Antarctica?
[ 0:02:26.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker B : No, in Brazil. Guanana. Antarctica. Yeah. There it is. That stuff's the shit, dude.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:44.000 ] Speaker A : And they give you a beer. You go down to the beach and they give you a beer in, like, this rock that's, like, ice cold. Well, I don't know if it's a rock, but whatever it is.
[ 0:02:44.000 ---> 0:02:44.000 ] Speaker B : Ceramic.
[ 0:02:44.000 ---> 0:02:50.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know, but it's really cold. And the beer is, like, the coldest beer I've ever had. And it was so good on the beach. It was so good.
[ 0:02:50.000 ---> 0:02:53.000 ] Speaker B : They know how to party down there on the beach in Brazil.
[ 0:02:53.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker A : It's so fun.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, it's great. Great country.
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:03:07.000 ] Speaker A : We're going down there for tour, so we got a lot of tours, so we're doing this US tour, then we're doing seven days off, then we go to South America, I think so. I'm excited.
[ 0:03:07.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker B : Wow. Have you performed in South America before?
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker A : Yes, sir. Yeah, rock and Rio and stuff. And it's so much fun, man. Yeah, they love music. It's, like, so much fun. It's just like, there's not, like, a piece, like, an ounce of hate in the whole crowd. Everybody's just having such a great time, and that makes me more excited because sometimes I'll go do these shows, like, a lot of more corporate shows where I'm just like, hey, do you guys even really like me or know who I am? But it's like, everybody there is just having so much fun.
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:03:42.000 ] Speaker B : Right? The corporate ones are weird, right?
[ 0:03:43.000 ---> 0:03:55.000 ] Speaker A : I have fun, but a lot of the time, it's like you can't read the crowd because everybody's. I feel like, more like a jazz band or like a lounge band at a restaurant or know.
[ 0:03:55.000 ---> 0:03:56.000 ] Speaker B : Right. Which is weird.
[ 0:03:56.000 ---> 0:03:57.000 ] Speaker A : It's weird.
[ 0:03:57.000 ---> 0:04:08.000 ] Speaker B : It's weird. They want to pay that much money to have someone come, and then it's just that you're a big name, and it's like, look, we got post Malone, but I'm over here talking to somebody, not paying attention.
[ 0:04:08.000 ---> 0:04:23.000 ] Speaker A : And, yeah, I don't know, you know, people who pay to come to the show. I'm like, okay, you guys paid. You guys definitely. You guys at least know who I am, for sure. But, yeah, I'm not sure. I can't read the crowd, but I.
[ 0:04:23.000 ---> 0:04:29.000 ] Speaker B : Went to my friend Dana White, and he had a birthday party when he was 40, and they hired Stone Temple pilots.
[ 0:04:29.000 ---> 0:04:29.000 ] Speaker A : Sick.
[ 0:04:30.000 ---> 0:05:01.000 ] Speaker B : It was sick. They were sick. First of all, those motherfuckers performed, like, there was 80,000 people there. And it was one of those things where we had to get people to stop and pay attention. Guys, fucking Stone Temple pilots is here. They went hard. I mean, they did full energy show. It was very impressive. It was, like, very inspirational. It's like, wow, these guys are at a birthday party and they're giving them fucking Stone Temple pilots?
[ 0:05:01.000 ---> 0:05:02.000 ] Speaker A : That's badass.
[ 0:05:02.000 ---> 0:05:06.000 ] Speaker B : It was badass. It was amazing. It was amazing.
[ 0:05:06.000 ---> 0:05:17.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know if I could. You just hear fucking interstate with an interstate love song, and you're like, how do you talk?
[ 0:05:17.000 ---> 0:05:19.000 ] Speaker B : How do you not just like, right?
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:20.000 ] Speaker A : How are you? Like, what the wait?
[ 0:05:20.000 ---> 0:05:20.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:05:20.000 ---> 0:05:21.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know.
[ 0:05:21.000 ---> 0:05:25.000 ] Speaker B : Well, just hobnobbing. That's the thing.
[ 0:05:25.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker A : Hobnobbing.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:56.000 ] Speaker B : And you go to those things and everybody's already hobnobing. So people are, like, social networking, and there's people with motives, and they're trying to be more friendly with the guy at the top and this kind of shit. And then all of a sudden. But they fucking went hard. They went hard. Like, they had the best fans in the world, and there was, like, 80,000 of them. It was a fucking amazing show. It was so impressive, man. It was so impressive.
[ 0:05:56.000 ---> 0:06:00.000 ] Speaker A : Another band with Stone, Queens of the Stone Age.
[ 0:06:00.000 ---> 0:06:02.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, those guys are great.
[ 0:06:02.000 ---> 0:06:03.000 ] Speaker A : I want to see them.
[ 0:06:03.000 ---> 0:06:06.000 ] Speaker B : I have not seen them live, but I had Josh on the show.
[ 0:06:06.000 ---> 0:06:07.000 ] Speaker A : How was he?
[ 0:06:07.000 ---> 0:06:07.000 ] Speaker B : Very cool guy.
[ 0:06:07.000 ---> 0:06:08.000 ] Speaker A : Yes, sir.
[ 0:06:08.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker B : Well, we had a good friend in Bourdain. He was good friends with Bourdain, too. He's fucking interesting dude, though. Very interesting dude. And their music is fucking.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:06:19.000 ] Speaker A : It's so smart.
[ 0:06:19.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker B : So interesting.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:21.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it's so smart.
[ 0:06:21.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. It's so dIstinctive. Their music is so distinctive. Like, you hear a song, it sounds like them.
[ 0:06:28.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker A : Right?
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker B : You know what I mean?
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker A : He's got a voice, man, and he can write a hell of a song.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:34.000 ] Speaker B : Hell of a song.
[ 0:06:34.000 ---> 0:06:51.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. It's just. I don't know. Like, some of the stuff they do, I'm like, how do you even think of that, right? There's so many artists like that, but I'm, like, in that setting. And then that first record with Dave just banging on, dude. Oh, my God. It's so good.
[ 0:06:51.000 ---> 0:07:00.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, it's so good. Well, we're at an amazing time for art, for both music and a lot of other things, too. There's just so much good shit out there now.
[ 0:07:00.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker A : That's true. But I figured at the way things are moving, I got like four or five months before people like the robot songs more than my song.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:12.000 ] Speaker B : I don't think that's.
[ 0:07:12.000 ---> 0:07:13.000 ] Speaker A : I hear some of them and I'm.
[ 0:07:13.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker B : Like, oh man, that's so good. Dude. Who wrote that? Was chat. GPT wrote that? Fuck, man. That's a great song. But it is a great song. But people will know. People will know there's women that do not want diamonds that were made in a lab.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker A : Sure.
[ 0:07:31.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker B : Which is crazy because there's a shiniest diamond. Like they have an ability now to man make diamonds. They have some crazy machine and they compress carbon and they can make diamonds but women only like them if they're coming out of the ground.
[ 0:07:44.000 ---> 0:07:50.000 ] Speaker A : Well, I know how to make gold. Really? Yeah, I can turn anything into gold. I watched a video on.
