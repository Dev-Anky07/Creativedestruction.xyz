- Welcome. Can people hear in the back? Can you guys hear me? Is the mic on? No. Maybe you can ask them to turn it on. All right. Maybe we can get a bigger auditorium.
- Y Combinator president Sam Altman is teaching CS 183 B. Guest speakers are going to teach 17 of the 20 classes. All of the advice is geared towards people starting a business where the goal is hypergrowth. Altman warns that if you try to do these things in a lot of other companies, it won't work.
- You need a great idea, a great product, agreat team and great execution. These overlap somewhat, but I'm going to have to talk about them somewhat individually. If you do really well in the four areas you can control, you have a good chance of success.
- You should never start a startup just for the sake of doing so. The specific passion should come first and the startup second. Most great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot. Great execution towards a terrible idea will get you nowhere.
- The idea should come first and the startup should come second. Wait to start a startup until you come up with an idea you feel compelled to explore. The best companies are almost always mission oriented. The hardest part about coming up with great ideas is that the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.
- In general, it's best if you're building something that you yourself need. The best ideas are usually either very different from existing companies. More important than starting any particular startup is getting to know a lot of potential co founders.
- To build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great product. Step one is to build something that users love. If you get this right, you can get a lot of other things wrong.
- You need some users to help with the feedback cycle, but the way to get those users is manually. Get users manually and remember that the goal is to get a small group of them to love you. Startups live on growth. It's the indicator of a great product.
- Dustin: There's a bunch of common reasons that people have to start a startup. Some of them only make sense in certain contexts. Dustin: You may have been misled by the way that Hollywood or the press likes to romanticize entrepreneurship. What you're actually spending your time on is a lot of hard work.
- The number one role of a CEO is managing your own psychology. Be aware that you're going to have to deal with this and you have to actually manage it. The most common thing I have to spend my time on and focus my energy on is the problems that other people are bringing to me.
- Candidates tell me they'd like to work for a much smaller company or start their own. How much money you might make as employee number 100 is a good benchmark. And that's how you should be benchmarking when you're thinking about what might I make as an entrepreneur.
- Your share of that company is pretty likely to be about 10%. This certainly fluctuates. If you have more than this, I'd recommend Sam's post on the equity split between founders and employees. This is only the value after four years, and this idea probably has legs.
- Why might joining a late stage company actually provide you a lot of impact? They have an existing massive user base. They have existing infrastructure you get to build on. Financial reward is very strongly correlated with the impact you have on the world.
