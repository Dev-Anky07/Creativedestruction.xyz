- In Newtonville, Massachusetts, there were a lot of scary kids. I hung out with those kids and smoked cigarettes in that park. Some of them were my friends. One of them was Ronnie DeVoe of Bel Biv. Devoe. It was so crazy.
- I really feel for people who get bullied. All those stories about me being bullied and thrown around led me to get into martial arts. Every extreme experience, bad and good, is food. It has the potential for a learning experience. It's up to you what you turn it into.
