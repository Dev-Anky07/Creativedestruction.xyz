- Stanley: I'm the founder of DoorDash. We're building an on demand delivery network for local cities. It wasn't actually that long ago where I sat in your seats.
- A few months ago, we raised our Series A. I took this photo because I realized just how ridiculous the combinations of things I was holding in my hand at the time. It kind of summarizes how ridiculous our journey has been, starting at Stanford and transitioning into an actual startup.
- Miles O'Brien: It all began two years ago, in a Macaroon store in Palo Alto, California. He says small business owners say they don't have delivery infrastructure. So how can we test this hypothesis? He says they launched a simple experiment with restaurant delivery.
- DoorDashes launched in less than an hour with a really simple landing page. You want to treat your startup ideas like experiments. Finally, it's okay to do things that don't scale when you're starting out.
- DoorDash is a mobile-based food delivery service. The company was founded to help small business owners through delivery back. Next up is Walker Williams from Teespring. Where do you plan to go beyond food delivery?
- Walker: One of the most fundamental advantages of starting a startup is that you can do things that don't scale. He says there is no silver bullet for user acquisition. First users are always going to be the hardest to get. Walker: Do whatever it takes to bring in your first users.
- One detractor who's had a terrible experience on your platform is enough to reverse the progress of ten champions. What's important is to always make it right, to always go the extra mile and make that customer happy. Those customers that are originally the most frustrated tend to turn into the biggest champions.
- The product you launch with will almost certainly not be the product that takes you to scale. You need to optimize for speed over scalability and clean code. You want to do things that don't scale as long as possible.
- The t shirt printing business has a lot of content. What convinced you to think this is a viable market? Great ideas start by looking like silly ideas. You can sort of feel out whether or not there's a scalable business here by how people are adopting it.
- Today our biggest customer base are entrepreneurs who are trying to build brands and businesses. And the other side is influencers. We still do work with a lot of nonprofits and love working with them. It's still a part of our business, just not the majority.
- With Press if you just aimlessly want to be covered it's not really going to do anything for your startup. If you don't have an actual goal for a business goal with it, it's really just not a good use of press.
- So what's an actual story? I think there's a bunch of different types of stories but these are usually the ones that you see in startups. Getting press is like, you can think of it like a sales funnel. Your press and news doesn't have to be original, it just has to be what I like to call original enough.
- Getting press is a lot of work so you should really make sure it's worth it. The best way to get coverage is really through warm introductions. You should help your fellow entrepreneurs get coverage because they will help you get coverage.
- When is the right time to start worrying about press altogether? I think it's a really good way. A lot of companies in YC when they first launch their product will encourage them to just do one Tech Crunch story to get few people to see it.
-  Twitch had this thing called Twitch Plays Pokemon, where developers set up a Pokemon like Game Boy game that was controlled by chat. We helped give it legs by making the company available to talk to the reporters and suggesting follow up stories. It was the community, really, who originated it.
