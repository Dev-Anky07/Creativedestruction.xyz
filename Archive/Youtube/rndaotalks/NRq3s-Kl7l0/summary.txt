- Arundao is a venture studio building the future of work. This is the first time ever, this is seeing the public light. Would love your feedback, your attention.
- Human collaboration is fundamentally toxic. Leaders are unhappy, workers are unhappy. Future of work is not Solopreneurs nor corporations, but swarms. Venture Studio is facilitating the rise of these modular product ecosystems.
- We have four autonomous teams, each building a modular product. We are building a brand positioning as web free thought leaders. We need cross venture ownership to incentivize collaboration. We'll soon be preparing for a fundraise to accelerate this vision.
- The invitation for all of you who are not part of Arundao already is to join us. You can do so by starting a venture with us. Join with your venture as long as it's related with this topic. And also to contribute to Arendao itself as a platform.
- Rndao is preparing for a fundraise. Two more ventures are starting to show traction. The group is trying to be a little bit in the middle of two polarities. It's a delicate balancing act and it will require constant thinking.
- Together Who is a tool that aims to create healthy communities. It uses data from discord to map the whole webtree ecosystem. The tool is currently only available to the discord admin, which has access to some data.
- Iron Dao is doing well. Got pocket this week and optimism a couple of weeks ago. Artem is going to present Harmonica, which is probably the latest startup to join Iron Dao. Well, we're going to keep the questions for end.
- Harmonica is AI powered chatbot for superfast sense making and deliberation. It combines large language model with Conversational UX to make decisions of higher quality and faster. If anyone is interested in checking out the product, please follow this link and I will personally facilitate a demo session.
- We decided to focus right now on a very niche market which. Is Venture clubs and angel networks. After that, we want to try to find product market fit with mutual and employee owned businesses. And finally, sometimes in the future, we'll try to use it for democratic dialogue or citizen engagement.
- So I'm going to move quickly on to Stackles if Ector is available. Can we ask Ramon if he wants to? Sorry. If we can try and keep it to five to ten, that'd be amazing.
- We are Stackers and we simplify the Web Three coordination experience. Stackers is a trusted portal to find all the tools that you need and you can safely click on the links. We abide by the principle of decentralization and interoperability. We have the right skills and knowledge to deliver a great solution to the community.
- Mitri wallet started as an alternative to Calendly but tailored to Web Three. People can schedule using their create accounts and schedule meetings just using their regular wallets. All information about the meeting is fully private and encrypted on the client side. We want to evolve to make cross not even big, but teams coordination a little bit easier.
- And that brings us three minutes before the top of the hour. Does anybody have any burning questions that they haven't shared in the chat or they'd like to draw attention to? Have a great weekend everybody.
