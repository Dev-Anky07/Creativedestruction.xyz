- Matt: Welcome to my Ted Talk. I'm going to try to focus on three things. There's a lot of stuff going on in layer two. Last one, I'll talk about some scalability issues that we're starting to coalesce around.
- Not all bridges are created equal. UX for users is tricky or even impossible, depending on the asset. One thing that we're exploring is fast withdrawal confirmation. Deep wallet integration, I would say, with fast bridging.
- The next thing I want to talk about is kind of compatibility, right? So we're in a good state right now in Arbitrum on a lot of layer twos. As you think about rollups in the future, we want to see broader language support for smart contract execution.
- As much as we can increase throughput and bandwidth and execution speed on the chain, more people will use it, more developers will build. Making performance for validators or for nodes that are serving as validators is something that's going to continue to be more important as time goes on.
- In order for state Bloat to be a problem, we need to get people to use blockchains outside of the canonical use cases we're comfortable with today. I personally would like to see a lot more use cases come to market with lower barriers to entry.
