- Part two of Culture and Team. Ben Silberman, the founder of Pinterest, and John and Patrick Collison, the founders of stripe. How that changes and evolves as these guys have scaled their companies up to 100 plus.
- Running a company based on what you celebrate is more exciting than what you punish. One that we've placed a large emphasis on as stripe has grown is transparency internally. I think culture to some degree is basically kind of the resolution to a bandwidth problem.
- The first ten hires are really hard. No batch of ten people will have as great an influence on the company as those first ten people. What have the three of you looked for when you've hired these initial employees to get the culture of the company right?
- John: For our first ten people, the things we sort of figured out that seemed to be important were they're all sort of very genuine and straight. They were people who really liked getting things finished. Being able to consistently get people excited about what you're doing will pay back dividends later.
- A bunch of our friends have sort of started companies right out of school. The most common failure mode seems to be doing something kind of overly niche or overly sort of specific and bounded. This is really problematic because it's actually quite hard to hire people for niche things.
- How do you identify who the really great people are? At Pinterest, we try to get a sense for what is really world class in that discipline. Really great people want to do things that are hard. Be transparent about what's going to be easy or hard.
- Hiring expert: Is this person probably the best out of all of their friends at what they do? He says referencing people is really important and can prove really useful over time. Those references are also a tremendous source of new recruits.
- Stripe CEO: Hiring is difficult, but not as difficult as making them happy and effective. As the company grows, he says, the onboarding process has to get a little bit more formalized. The more feedback you can give people, the better they'll do, he adds.
- As Pinterest grows from two to ten to 100 to 1000 employees, how do you manage and run the teams? The goal is to make the teams feel as autonomous and nimble as possible. What are the biggest changes you've made to your hiring processes?
- Time horizons change very quickly in a rapidly growing company. How do you build good social bonds between people? What's the least bad way of managing that period of growth? Human organizations aren't designed for it.
- Stripe values transparency. Have you scaled it over time? Two things that have helped us scale it are changing the tools and developing the culture around it.
- I think overall it's great. It can often be quite distracting from your own work. Do you think email transparency was net good? Yes. I remember having a hard time understanding what I should and should not subscribe to.
- Is it your experience that your early hires are able to grow and evolve into leadership roles as the company scales? And a question for Ben. How is what is today different in your initial vision of what the product and the audience would be?
- How do you convince people to make sacrifices to join a startup? How can you be authentic like selling that vision of the company? Or is it about giving high returns for the high risk?
- How has your user base affected your hiring strategy? For us, we screen for people that are ambitious and excited about the vision of cracking discovery online. Finding people who are passionate about your product can be a great way to find people.
