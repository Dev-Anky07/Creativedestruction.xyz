- Ask an Arbanot episode one features Bellman, one of the technical recruiters at Arbitrum. I'm starting to pick up the pattern that everyone got sick over the Thanksgiving holiday. Real Thanksgiving was last month.
- Eli Bellman is the technical recruiter here at offtrain Labs. Hunter Hunter is one of two community managers at Arbitram. It's been a very interesting year, at least from the crypto market space. There's always something interesting to break through the noise of the headlines.
- Before Arbitram, Bellman, he worked as a recruitment coordinator on the international side. His niche focus was more of technology and just really it was just tech overall. He says anyone who started in 2018 to 2020 can consider themselves a soft veteran in the space.
- Remote work really works for a lot of people. I think I've increased my production tenfold just because of it. I also am a very big social person. I love to go up to New York, grab a WeWork or just meet up with folks. Canada has the opposite of everything the US has.
- Mainly right now, we're really focused on our blockchain developer role and our integration engineer role. Outside of that, I also am helping with partnerships primarily with the Web three gaming role.
- On the non technical side, on the non developer roles, the Executive Assistant, Operations Manager, HR Generalist. Outside of those, the Associate Product Manager is very technically knowledge. And then empowering those who are the smartest in the room.
- Even fresh out of college, it's such a very different recruitment environment here in the US. Compared to globally, that talent is also a bit more junior in the sense of trying to find the right opportunity. Experience can play a huge role, depending on the role.
- Going out, finding a Dow, finding some project that you're able to kind of attach yourself to and grow with them is only going to help grow your career throughout college specifically. Some people have asked me, hey, I have a great background. What role do you recommend me for?
- A lot of people transition from web two to web three. When was the snapping point for you? I was like, I can't work in a traditional work environment anymore. It's starting to blend a lot between online and in real world.
- How does your timeline for hiring look given all the layoffs at large tech companies, will arbitram continue to hire through the holidays? One book I highly recommend is for the foundation out there for a good financial or foundational principle.
- Any advice for someone trying to get a biz dev job in web three? Creating a sales pitch and even outreach in this space is totally different than traditional business development. Time is going to be your best friend.
- What is your favorite hot food right now? Chicken cheesesteak. Favorite cold food? Sushi 100%. Or a nice poke bowls? The joke here is that it's hot wallets and cold wallets.
- Not bandwagon education projects, but more so top notch via alchemy or something like that. This goes specifically for what role? Right back to the business development example from earlier. The ones via Alchemy are very good.
- Dow Tools has a project called Dwork that lets users apply for jobs on the side. It's a great way for, I guess, like Web Three job economy. Small businesses here in the US could greatly benefit from something like this.
- Eli: Is there a job for the community? Like in discord part time? I've been in Arbitrum discord for almost two years. I have a lot of free time daily hope to do more work for the Arbitram community. Keep your eyes open for any opportunities that might arise.
- On ramps are something that will be a big part of adoption and onboarding new users. GMX is definitely on my radar when it comes to, I think, just ease of use. I think we're going to have maybe one day going from straight from our bank into L two or even back onto Ethereum.
- Are there any other projects that you know of on Arbitrum that are hiring other than Arbitram? We're trying to work on like an ecosystem job board where different projects can kind of come in and list their positions. I definitely want to help out as much as possible.
- Off Chain Labs is an entity, it's an organization here in the US. And we are able to hire internationally, too. Do you count as a contractor as well, or how does that work? There are ways to kind of get it done.
- Bellman: When I was young in college, I would work like, OD end jobs. The first time I got exposure to recruitment from a corporate level. He says he paved his own fun with his own excitement. Bellman: How do I get someone into a better position than they are now?
- Beast: Back when he was studying different YouTube videos, he would come together with his friends. They would all sit on a call together for like 1214, 15 hours a day, and they would all learn from each other's mistakes. That's what I tried to do when I onboard people into blockchain.
- The Web Three ecosystem has a shorter average lifespan for jobs I. E. Do employees come and go often? Or is it more similar to regular tech where working for a project for three to six months and moving to something as unusual? Every project is going to be different and depends on you as a person.
- Right now, I just want to put out I the past hour, however long we've been talking, we went long. This has been just the overall best feeling I've had in the past three days. Your medicine was just engagement. All right, we'll see you next time.
