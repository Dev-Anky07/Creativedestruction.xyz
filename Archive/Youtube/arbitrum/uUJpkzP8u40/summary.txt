- All right. What's going on, guys? Hey, how's it going? Doing good, doing good. Is Garp coming? Garp, can you request hey, everyone, TB here.
- Hey, TB. It's going to be a lot of people speaking on today's AMA. Thanks so much for hosting this for us, guys. We appreciate your community and our ecosystem. Very excited to talk about all this stuff.
- Nina is community manager China and leading partnerships for Arbitram. Also a big fan of the treasure verse ecosystem. Only managed to get whitelisted last week. Joined by the Toad schools team as well as some of the mods.
- We'd really love for our mods to come up afterwards and tell us a little bit more about themselves. Toto TB the artist for toadstools. Also known as Michelangelode on the discord. I'm really excited about the AMA, and thanks for hosting.
- Skunk is the writer for Toadstools. He will bring all the narrative and storylines to Toads going forward. Please, Skunk, do a segment on Toadstool. You can feature us in one of your shows. An animated show about Toads would be so cool.
- And I think it's waiting on then Garp, and then we can maybe go to some of the mods. If you guys want to bring some mods up, let me go ahead and see if any of them have requested. I can try and get them up here.
- Toadstools are spread all over the world, and we all have different jobs. We'd love to hear how you all got into Toast Tool. Tuesday, for me, will be the mint, but I'm looking forward to it.
- TikTok is one of the mods for Toad Stools. He brings on Enigma as well. Who wants to go next? Maybe while we find Tickle.
- Enigma is a Canadian living down in New Zealand. He got into crypto via Bone Goat. Now he's working on his own project in the background. Maybe Horo. The Horologist? He's a little charmander they requested.
- Damazonian thanks Small Goat for bringing him to Toad Stools. Joey thanks Gwen and Ud for coming up with some of the ridiculous questions. The space is crazy, but I'm just blessed to be where I am.
- Toads is a unique, randomly generated on chain NFT. Every toad will be generated on Mint, and you will see your Toad immediately. It will be a casual game about collecting and trading NFTs. bugs are non transferable, which means you cannot trade bugs.
- Hunter: What kind of made Treasure really good and what kind of drew people in was very grassroots kind of community first, kind of bottom up build. We're thinking of putting them in there in a more formal capacity. Our vision of bugs is it is a consumption or a consumer currency, so it's all about spending bugs.
- One of the things we're doing at the moment is art collaborations. You will have an opportunity to turn the gachapon and kind of like Pokemon collect them all. Expect more opportunities to win Toads and other croakshire items.
- Toads will be able to collect items on adventures, which will be like collectible NFTs. For the Toad Mint, it is a free mint. Please don't click on any links to mint, it won't work.
- There will be some hectic one of ones which TB has prepared. They will not be mintable because their features cannot be randomly generated. Will be given out via either luck, speed or skill. Already have two winners of the one of one so far.
- Gwen is one of the winners who got the spatial surprise for the toad teams. In real life, she is a business analyst for a social media company. Thanks for coming up, Gwen. We love you.
- Timmy Ice: Could we bring up Small Goat if he's there? Small Goat? Just to say hi. Can't wait for Tuesday. A couple of people and just have anyone speak when they get up here. If anyone has any specific questions, feel free to raise your hand.
- Garp: The intention is that the Toto decks will probably be a little bit more expansive than just the gotcha. There'll be limited amount of things you can collect because the season will move on. Gachapon might be one way to get it, but engaging in other fun forms of kind of interplay will be another.
- I love this team, mainly because obviously I'm an Aussie as well. And their guys have continued to onboard team members in the appropriate space. I think they'll take care of the community and help push another game towards the magic ecosystem. I can't wait for Tuesday.
- Because of worldwide time zones, some of your mint date says the 19th. We will not be minting while Australia is asleep. One big hint is we need to be awake to mint.
- Hi, guys. So happy to be up here. Wishing you guys a successful launch ahead. Great job from all the team members and the mods. You guys are amazing. Can't wait to see what you guys are for us.
- Wise is a key dev on Treasure. Everything from smalls to the marketplace, Bridgewell, everywhere. We love working with the broader treasure ecosystem. Ud, are you there? I still haven't been able to see if you've come up.
- Eudene: I've been crypto since 2021. I joined Treasure January end, 2022. So far, the toad stools is the best team I have came across. The whole team is basically like my family, and I just love them.
- The on chain kind of randomization of art is something that we'll kind of lean really heavily into. I'm getting more and more excited the more you speak. Do you want to bring up a couple more people? One more person. End it here.
- The plan is definitely to build on the Tools Tools project. We don't have any plans to start a new one. Look out for new worlds, new places, new islands maybe. We're really excited to see what you guys think about it.
- All right. I really want some toad merch. Would love a toad tea. Can we get a tank top going? I'm trying to show up on an embroidered little toed tank top at the beach or something, please.
- Is the user interface optimized for owning more than one toad? More toads equals more bugs, equals more NFTs to collect. If you want to buy up big, that's entirely up to you.
- From launch day, if you have more than one toad, you can stake all and you can start hunting all. The reason why we did that as well is to save on gas fees as well. There's definitely ways in which you can do things with multiple toads.
- As far as bulk action, ready to go on day one. As far as Etherworks coming off Raid Rush, their event that they're just having now with a huge hoard. Looking forward to any cross world events you guys might have in store.
- I've invited up Cold Water from the chat. It's going to be about security issues. We've heard about discord servers getting hacked and people clicking on fake links and getting robbed. How do you guys intend to prevent that from happening?
- Toad Stools and us speak about their launch coming this Tuesday. Happy Easter to everybody. We're really looking forward to the launch next week. It's been great to chat and speak to some more of the community guys. Have a good one.
