- Michael today is going to talk to us about peer to peer ecosystems, some topics about cosmolocatalism civilizational transitions. What I mean with peer topeer is basically the capacity for non territorial coordination. And so create forms of organization and coordination that are no longer bound with geography.
- The way we organize our society is changing. I sometimes say we shift from a Marxist capitalism to a prudonian capitalism. I usually show a quadrant that distinguishes the global centralized from the local distributed and for profit and not for profit priorities.
- The rule of cosmolocalism is everything that's heavy is local. Everything that's light is global and shared. It's the idea of combining an effort to relocalize provisioning systems but keeping the complex cooperation at the level of knowledge, science and technology. crypto is creating infrastructures for this new coordination system to exist.
- There are three new accounting systems emerging which are responding to this need. The commons economy is not a commodity economy. It's a contributive economy which has markets and state functions around it. To some degree, crypto is a secession of the elite.
- When Rome fell in the fifth century, there was no food. Through viral spreading of this model of this basically agricultural co op, he restored what they restored Italian agriculture. I believe in seeds that are exemplary of the new paradigm and that eventually connect to each other and eventually create a new society.
- Artem: I'm curious to see how you approach reconciling some potential antagonisms between the local interests and global interests. He argues that we need to be technologically, scientifically complex to compete with the existing system. Artem: We cannot abandon the cosmic level because that's a depository of complex knowledge.
- Can we define localization beyond the physical sense? What properties would describe local, regional and global? Finally, how do various variables relate differently to local versus global commons?
- The dispute is between what is the right relationship between commons and markets. I think markets are distinct from capitalism. The idea of keeping commons pure is actually counterproductive. We need healthy markets that work for the commons and we cannot leave the markets to the capitalists.
- Michael: A market behaves and continues to behave as a local or generative market. The idea of an open co op is to structurally and legally force yourself as a co op to create commons. B corporations, social Entrepreneurs, solidarity Economy, cooperative Economy, mission Oriented Enterprise.
- Daniel: I just want to support exactly what you are saying about needing the market consolidation as a reference point. Where interesting, nominal explorations in local pricing can be that first sort of exploration of firewalling, badly overpriced products. Michelle: I really appreciate your median interpretation of these elements.
- In Italy, you have the first ever pro commons public regulation. The city, the commercial sector, the academic sector and the formal nonprofit sector mobilize to help the fifth sector, which is the informal civic common sector. We need to mutualize provisioning system.
- Daniel: Super interesting pattern. I hadn't thought about it more for microorganization design. It makes a lot of sense as a fractal pattern. Do we have anyone else that wants to ask a question before we cap things off?
- In certain states, there's something called the home rule, where you can form a municipality. You can actually have a municipal corporation that writes its own ordinances. A municipality can engage in market activities, provided that it's for the common good.
- Harrison: What you've just identified is emerging in South Africa again, where top down failure to govern has resulted in such provocative kind of bottom up contestational moves. This kind of mix of the real concrete with the blockchain, that's the kind of things that I'm looking at.
