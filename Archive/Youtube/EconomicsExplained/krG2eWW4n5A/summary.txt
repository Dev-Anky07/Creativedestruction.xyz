- In July, Norway discovered the world's largest supply of readily available phosphate. The discovery is worth around $24 trillion. How is Norway going to manage this new influx of wealth? Could too much of a good thing potentially be the miracle economy's undoing?

- Norway discovered large and exploitable oil and natural gas deposits in the North Sea in the late 1960s. The country mandated that the state must have 50% participation in every production license sold to private companies. Norway has historically kept a remarkably high share of those revenues for itself and its people.
- The discovery of the country's phosphate reserves has the potential to make North Sea oil and natural gas almost insignificant by comparison. Phosphate is refined and used in everything from high performance batteries to solar panels. If Norway starts to extract and sell this material in bulk, it will inevitably drive prices down in international markets.
- Norway has one of the lowest rates of brain drain in the world. The reason is simply culture. Norwegians could earn more, but don't really value big, expensive luxuries. Most workers in Norway don't want to give that up to earn more money elsewhere.
- Norway has the second highest per capita output of any country in the world. The country's social cohesion, robust democratic system and intense focus on building a financial safety net means that Norway is probably one of the safest economies. But it has slower than average growth, which is likely to improve in the coming years.
