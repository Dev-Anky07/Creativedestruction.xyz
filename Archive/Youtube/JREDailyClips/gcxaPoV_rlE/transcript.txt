[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker A : Like even the guy who was literally with him in the gym. He could be lying to my face though too. But he said he had no, you know, recollection of them, no idea that they were doing anything. As far as he knows, it was all natural.
[ 0:00:12.000 ---> 0:00:28.000 ] Speaker B : I'm just like, yeah, it's a weird world, isn't it? Like where you're supposed to kind of be full of shit about that stuff. Yeah, because it's so obvious to people. Like one of the interesting things, I.
[ 0:00:28.000 ---> 0:01:01.000 ] Speaker A : Don'T actually think it's problematic, by the way, for somebody to juice up for a role to represent a superhero character. It's more when they lie. But they also have marketing and or products centered around their physiques and what they achieved for that role. Like, for example, with Hemsworth, he has like this app that sold for $200 million that is centered around workouts and stuff. But some of the marketing around that will be like, train like Thor. This is what Thor did, how to get his physique sort of thing. That's where it gets kind of murky in my opinion, more so.
[ 0:01:01.000 ---> 0:02:01.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with doing steroids to achieve that sort of physique for a movie either. I do think there's something wrong with lying about and. But there's also, if you went on a show, see when Mickey Rourke did it, he did it for the wrestler. When he talked about it, he talked about doing steroids for the wrestler. And that was a movie that wasn't really about a hero. It was about a guy who's down and out and he's all fucked up and he's doing drugs and he's a mess. It's not an admirable character that people would aspire to be. Like Black Adam when you see the rock and he's standing there with his shirt off, with his shorts on, there's not a man alive doesn't want to be built like that. They all want to be built like that. So if he's telling you that he's not doing anything to get that, and I don't know if he is, is he telling people, does he say, I've never taken steroids in my life. Does he say that?
[ 0:02:01.000 ---> 0:02:11.000 ] Speaker A : He said in one instance that when he was 18 him and his friends took something and it gave him gynecomastia and then he never touched it again or something like that.
[ 0:02:11.000 ---> 0:02:12.000 ] Speaker B : That seems suspect.
[ 0:02:12.000 ---> 0:02:13.000 ] Speaker A : Super suspect.
[ 0:02:13.000 ---> 0:02:18.000 ] Speaker B : First of all, when you're 18, just doing something once is not going to give you Gyno.
[ 0:02:18.000 ---> 0:02:36.000 ] Speaker A : It could. Could it really? The most prevalence I've seen of gyno development is in individuals who, without enough information, went into haphazard use of a pro hormone or, like, an oral steroid without understanding the pharmacology around it, and then fucked themselves up one time.
[ 0:02:36.000 ---> 0:02:37.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:02:37.000 ---> 0:02:37.000 ] Speaker B : Really?
[ 0:02:38.000 ---> 0:02:38.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:02:38.000 ---> 0:02:41.000 ] Speaker A : Like, you do, like, a heavy cycle of deball or something. Get some gyno.
[ 0:02:41.000 ---> 0:02:43.000 ] Speaker B : No shit. I thought it would take a few.
[ 0:02:43.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker A : Cycles to develop into, like, a significant matured titty then.
[ 0:02:49.000 ---> 0:02:49.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:02:50.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker A : But it depends on the genetic predisposition, because some guys get Gyno just through puberty too.
[ 0:02:55.000 ---> 0:02:56.000 ] Speaker B : Really?
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:02:56.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:02:59.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, it's just a natural thing that just fucks up.
[ 0:02:59.000 ---> 0:02:59.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:02:59.000 ---> 0:03:08.000 ] Speaker B : Interesting. Yeah. Well, him saying that he did something once when he was 18, he got Gyno. Like, how'd you take care of it? Would you do? To get rid of the gyno?
[ 0:03:08.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, presumably.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker C : Right.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:10.000 ] Speaker B : You have to have an operation.
[ 0:03:10.000 ---> 0:03:11.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:03:11.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker B : People need to understand that's not fluid. That's like, a gland gets bigger. Right?
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:19.000 ] Speaker A : It's like a literal glandular tissue that you need to get surgically removed.
[ 0:03:19.000 ---> 0:03:21.000 ] Speaker B : Have you ever seen it, the operation?
[ 0:03:21.000 ---> 0:03:22.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, yeah, I've done videos on it.
[ 0:03:22.000 ---> 0:03:23.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, that's right, you have.
[ 0:03:23.000 ---> 0:03:24.000 ] Speaker A : It's horrible.
[ 0:03:25.000 ---> 0:03:31.000 ] Speaker B : It's like you're pulling those little alien chest bursters out of your titty. It's amazing how much mass there is behind those things.
[ 0:03:31.000 ---> 0:03:32.000 ] Speaker C : No. Yeah.
[ 0:03:32.000 ---> 0:03:43.000 ] Speaker A : Even for such. Like, a little something that's just barely protruding cosmetically. Just at an objective look, when you actually look at what came out, it's like, damn, that's a fucked ton of tissue.
[ 0:03:43.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker B : It's a fucking egg.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:45.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:03:45.000 ---> 0:03:52.000 ] Speaker B : It's gross. If he's saying that that's all he's ever done. That's crazy talk.
[ 0:03:52.000 ---> 0:03:53.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:03:53.000 ---> 0:04:00.000 ] Speaker A : It's like, at that point, it's weird. It's like trying to half tell the truth, but not at all at the same time.
[ 0:04:00.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker B : Also, when you look at his physique in the early days of the WWE.
[ 0:04:03.000 ---> 0:04:03.000 ] Speaker C : Oh.
[ 0:04:04.000 ---> 0:04:05.000 ] Speaker A : Nothing comparable in comparison.
[ 0:04:05.000 ---> 0:04:29.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Let's go to the early days of the rock. He was, like, very athletic, great genetics, big, strong guy, but he didn't look anything like he looks now. The mass and the striations and the vascularity, this version of him did, but, like, this version definitely didn't. Yeah. Like, that version, his fit on the right.
[ 0:04:29.000 ---> 0:04:29.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:04:29.000 ---> 0:04:31.000 ] Speaker B : Looks good. But look at the difference there.
[ 0:04:31.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:04:34.000 ---> 0:04:51.000 ] Speaker B : I mean, looks very fit. He's pretty jacked. That's more recent, because that's the crazy tattoo. That's him. Now, this is much older. I mean, he's a fucking massive heavily muscle.
[ 0:04:51.000 ---> 0:04:52.000 ] Speaker A : Some shots of him where it's just.
[ 0:04:52.000 ---> 0:05:00.000 ] Speaker B : Like, so what kind of stuff do you think? Well, he looks pretty good there. He just doesn't look lean.
[ 0:05:00.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker A : I think there was like type in the rock Scorpion King. I think that was an old enough movie where it was like on the red carpet. The guy just looked like a totally, I don't know, like a shell of what he is now. And that was.
[ 0:05:17.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker B : Bad.
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:20.000 ] Speaker A : Maybe this isn't a good example.
[ 0:05:21.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker B : Why don't you look red carpet.
[ 0:05:24.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker A : It looks pretty good there. That's good. I forget which.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:29.000 ] Speaker B : Well, maybe on the red carpet he was cycle.
[ 0:05:29.000 ---> 0:05:38.000 ] Speaker A : There was one picture where it just looked like dramatically different. I don't remember exactly what year it was, but. Okay, it wasn't that year.
[ 0:05:38.000 ---> 0:05:59.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, no, he looks pretty big. Yeah, look, he's a giant dude, massive human being. And clearly when he's lean and he looks great. But what do you think you would have to do to achieve that kind of a physique? At 51st of all, you wouldn't maintain that kind of mass as you naturally got older normally, right?
[ 0:05:59.000 ---> 0:06:21.000 ] Speaker A : No, definitely not. Again, there's a reason why I feel that your body naturally down regulates a lot of processes too, potentially to conserve, stay alive longer, because the bigger of a human you are, the faster you're going to die. In general, I don't see many seven foot guys walking around at 80 plus years old. Personally, very few.
[ 0:06:21.000 ---> 0:06:25.000 ] Speaker B : Bill Russell was like one of the few. He passed away. How old was he though?
[ 0:06:25.000 ---> 0:06:25.000 ] Speaker A : He was quite old.
[ 0:06:26.000 ---> 0:06:27.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, I think he got close to 90.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:06:28.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker A : Okay.
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:29.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:06:29.000 ---> 0:06:53.000 ] Speaker A : But in general, Even bodybuilders, again, they're subjecting themselves to absurd amounts of drugs. But at the same time, the sheer body weight and the stress it imposes on all organ systems and the longevity of everything internally, not just, it's all something that accelerates you towards death faster, essentially. So it's like total antithesis of longevity at the end of the day.
[ 0:06:53.000 ---> 0:06:53.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:06:53.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker A : So, yeah, you're definitely not going to be able to sustain that at 50, even on HRT. He's going to have to transiently push the envelope fairly often if he's doing multiple roles on a consistent basis that require this look. And it seems like he's been pretty fucking dialed about maintaining it like year over year now.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:16.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, he's never really gotten thin or fat or never shrunk down, then built back up.
[ 0:07:16.000 ---> 0:07:42.000 ] Speaker A : There's definitely something about once you've built the tissue, you can retain it with a very modest amount or at least to some extent, it's still going to typically be something outside of what would be normally achievable in terms of your hormone production. Because if you went totally natural, you would just fucking melt away. But a lot of it is the building the muscle, I'm sure you can attest to. Building muscle is magnitudes harder than it is to just hold your physique.
[ 0:07:42.000 ---> 0:07:42.000 ] Speaker B : Yes.
[ 0:07:42.000 ---> 0:07:58.000 ] Speaker A : So you could get away with maybe working out a few times a week with very moderate volume and maintain exactly what you have. But to actually build, you're going to have to go into a surplus. You're going to have to increase your volume, you're going to have to increase your rest, your sleep quality, duration, et cetera. It's all very demanding.
