[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:04.000 ] Speaker A : One of the most compelling and fascinating videos that I watched was those mountain people.
[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:00:06.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, the Whitaker family.
[ 0:00:06.000 ---> 0:00:06.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:00:06.000 ---> 0:00:08.000 ] Speaker B : In West Virginia.
[ 0:00:08.000 ---> 0:00:10.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. How'd you find them?
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker B : That was during created equal, the book that I mentioned. He. I was, you know, I was going to each other's lower 48 states, and we were in West Virginia just driving around. Axel, my assistant, and I, he's, he's worked with me for decades. We're just driving around looking for anybody interesting to photograph. It was just like, let's just see what we can find. And we're in a truck stop, convenience store, gas station thing, and I'm inside and there's a cop in there. And cops always know everybody in their county or whatever. This is a Raleigh county cop. And I went up to him, told him what I'm doing, and he goes, oh, yeah, I know all kinds of people. I'm like, I bet you do. He goes, I get off at 02:00 and I go, I'll meet you here, too. So we did. I've had people like this before who have helped me. This guy was probably the best I've ever had. He took me to pure gold over and over and over. All these interesting people who I photographed for create equal. He knew exactly what I'm looking for. He showed me the best of the best of Raleigh County. It was great. I'm sure there's more. I know there's more, but the ones he showed me were so great. And the first day we did this, we shot this person. We shot that. We shot a third, and then it started raining. And my strobe equipment, I always use strobe equipment for my photograph. This is photographs only at the time. This is for a photo book. Got rained, and so we had to pack up and leave. Can't rent photo gear in West Virginia, so we just had to go back to LA. And I told him, we'll be back in two weeks. So we come back and he says, when you come back, make sure you bring video. I'm like, yeah, yeah. I don't do video. So I didn't say anything. But two weeks later, we come back and he meets us and he goes, did you bring video cameras? I'm like, I don't do video. He got really pissed. He's like, you're going to want video. I don't do video. I'm sorry. Just photos. So we follow him. He's in one car, not a cop car, but his own private car. And we're following him in our rental, and we're going off the highway. Then we go off to this mountain road and it's winding through the mountains. Beautiful country. Appalachia, western West Virginia and eastern Kentucky is right near the border of Kentucky. It's so beautiful. It's one of the most beautiful parts of the US. And this windy road turns into, like, a gravel road and then turns into a dirt road. And there's shacks. Every once in a while you see a house. If somebody lives there, you can't believe people live there. And we're going very poor. I mean, the poverty in that part of the West Virginia is like these people are making, I think, an average of 12,000 a month. That's what they live on. So we're going down this dirt road and then we come around this bend and we're going really slow.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker A : 12,000 a month.
[ 0:02:56.000 ---> 0:02:59.000 ] Speaker B : I'm sorry. 12,000 a year? Yeah, $12,000 a year.
[ 0:02:59.000 ---> 0:03:01.000 ] Speaker A : How do they live on 12,000 a month? I was like, that's actually.
[ 0:03:02.000 ---> 0:03:52.000 ] Speaker B : No, I'm sorry. 12,000 a year? Yeah, 12,000 a year. Can you imagine that? No, it's crazy. That's like, parts of Kentucky and West Virginia are like that. So poor. So we're driving down this dirt road, we come around this bend, there's a shack on the left and there's a trailer on the right. Small trailer. And there's about ten or twelve people just walking around. And we're going really slow. So they're not used to cars coming by at all, but going that slow. We got their attention. And it's like everyone you look at is like their eyeballs are going this way. And a single tooth among them, not a single tooth in any of their heads. And they look at us and we look at them and they start yapping and screaming and barking. And some of them are just staring at us and drooling. And it was like, yeah, these people.
[ 0:03:52.000 ---> 0:03:55.000 ] Speaker A : This was the video. The inbred family. The Whitakers.
[ 0:03:56.000 ---> 0:03:56.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:03:56.000 ---> 0:03:58.000 ] Speaker A : Let's play some of this, because.
[ 0:04:00.000 ---> 0:04:01.000 ] Speaker C : What are your.
[ 0:04:04.000 ---> 0:04:05.000 ] Speaker D : Timmy.
[ 0:04:06.000 ---> 0:04:07.000 ] Speaker C : I'm sorry, what's.
[ 0:04:07.000 ---> 0:04:09.000 ] Speaker D : His name's Ray.
[ 0:04:09.000 ---> 0:04:14.000 ] Speaker C : Ray. I remember Ray. I photographed you, Ray. Do you remember? Years ago.
[ 0:04:14.000 ---> 0:04:16.000 ] Speaker A : So that sound is this man barking.
[ 0:04:17.000 ---> 0:04:19.000 ] Speaker C : Lorraine and Timmy.
[ 0:04:20.000 ---> 0:04:21.000 ] Speaker B : None of them speak now.
[ 0:04:21.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker C : You guys grew up here in Odd West Virginia. How many years have you lived here? Did you go to school? You did. Some of your brothers and sisters probably didn't go to school or. How much schooling did they get?
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:04:47.000 ] Speaker B : These are all brothers and sisters.
[ 0:04:51.000 ---> 0:04:53.000 ] Speaker C : You graduated from what?
[ 0:04:53.000 ---> 0:04:54.000 ] Speaker D : When I was in high school.
[ 0:04:54.000 ---> 0:04:56.000 ] Speaker C : You went to high school. Timmy.
[ 0:04:56.000 ---> 0:04:59.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah, he went to high school.
[ 0:04:59.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker B : Timmy graduated grade. High school. Doesn't speak a word. He's actually Lorraine's daughter.
[ 0:05:06.000 ---> 0:05:07.000 ] Speaker A : Son.
[ 0:05:10.000 ---> 0:05:11.000 ] Speaker C : Come on out.
[ 0:05:12.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker A : And that's a man barking for people just listening to this.
[ 0:05:15.000 ---> 0:05:16.000 ] Speaker B : That's all he.
[ 0:05:18.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker A : So they live with a bunch of dogs, and he's adopted. Their way of communicating.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker B : I don't know about that, but he does sound like a dog when he speaks.
[ 0:05:28.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker A : Here he is right here. So some of it's a dog, some of it is him.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:45.000 ] Speaker B : They sound very similar.
[ 0:05:45.000 ---> 0:05:53.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, that's a dog barking. And that's him. Now, what is the story of this family?
[ 0:05:53.000 ---> 0:07:58.000 ] Speaker B : So it's Ray on the left, Timmy in the center. This Lorraine's son, not daughter. And that's Freddie on the right, who. Freddie has passed away. So let me tell the story about how we met. So we pull up and these people are just staring at us. And it's something that. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. I'm certain I will never see anything crazier than this. And we pull the cars over. Me and the cop get out, and the cop comes up to me and says, I told you should have brought a video camera. I'm like, yeah, you were right. So I walk over to the house to ask them if I could photograph them. And I think one of the sisters just points to the trailer home across the road. So I go to the trailer home, and there's a man sitting on the couch with two women. And I poke my head in. The door was open, so I poked my head in and I said, my name's Mark. I'm a photographer from California. I just started giving my spiel, and he interrupts me and says, sorry, sir. We had death in the family. We're mourning. We're not interested at this time. And I'm just like, fuck. Came all the way out here and I got to be respectful. Somebody died. So I just like, okay, I'll check in with you later. And I left. I go back to the cop and Axel, and I'm talking to him like, fuck, we came at the wrong time. But then I started thinking, I'm fast on my feet, thinking I'm shooting eight by ten film and eight by ten Polaroids. So you get an instant Polaroid. So I have the ability to take pictures of the family. And I thought maybe that might be nice to give them eight by ten prints, these instant Polaroids of their family. And they can include that in the casket of a. I think it was their sister in law who passed away.
