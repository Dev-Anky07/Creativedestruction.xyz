- Lana is the author of the book Community Builder designing Communities for Change. She's the co founder of the Community Rituals and Neurodiversity Education Academy. Today she'll be sharing with us quite a bit about her experience. And we're going to be discussing engagement.
- This is a way to look at who's in the room. With this sticky note, just write your name. In this polarity of introvert or extrovert, where do you find yourself? Where do you see yourself in it?
- With what words, feelings, or images do you associate with the terms community engagement? OOH. Taking part in rituals, cycles of empathy and listening, belonging. Have 1 minute to go.
- Lani Yelenyev: What we will be doing is you will be sharing a memory of when you were in a community and what made you engaged in that community. As you are sharing, the rest of us listening will be using the practice of listening with the third ear. This is an exercise that you might try out further in your communities.
- The Community Canvas was released in 2017. Project aims to shift our understanding of community from community building to community weaving. How can we see community breathing as a factor of creating regenerative communities?
- Well, how I was sharing a while ago is, again, this shifting of perspective of engagement. How might engagement be looked at not from a passive lens, but from a differentiated lens. How are we providing different opportunities for people to engage based on their heart, health, energy and resources.
- The slider method or model wherein we look at engagement as a slider that people can slide in and out of different spaces. At the center of the community are the possibilities, the fire, and in this fire we have people that need to tend to that fire. We need to respect where people are at, at a given time and place.
- In our own community, in Arundao, we are doing very little for the middle. How are we seeing where people are at? Does this work for offline communities as well?
- Daniel: You mentioned the sort of listening circles. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? This needs to have a firm boundary of what is acceptable in these listening spaces. It needs someone that can hold the space well.
- In Dows there is a sort of layer of engagement that's very loose. I'm also seeing David shared being more intentional in crafting community. Looking at the community as comprised as individuals with complex needs rather than community. Community is a level of scale.
- Paula: Does this tool work for both communities of practice and communities of product? How can we best engage members in a community of product without making it seem like a marketing channel? One tool that might be helpful is the Satir change model.
- Lana: Please do connect with me at LinkedIn or with my website. I do have events that I hold, like on the 20th, I'll be doing an envisioning. So for those who would want to envision 2023 in ways that's more regenerative and restorative.
