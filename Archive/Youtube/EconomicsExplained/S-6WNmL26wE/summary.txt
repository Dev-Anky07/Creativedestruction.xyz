- On August 15, 1971 president Richard Nixon announced that the United States would be terminating the convertibility of American dollars into gold. This decision preceded two decades of record high inflation in the US. Following the global financial crisis of 2008 there were renewed calls for the return of a gold standard.
- The gold standard as it existed up until 1971 was first introduced in 1944. Currencies act like shock absorbers for international trade. If a currency is fixed, then this self correcting force can't do its thing and economies can quickly spiral out of control. Is returning to the gold standard something that could fix the economic issues that we are facing today?
- Another big advantage of the gold standard is that it prevents most types of financial repression. A gold standard also prevents governments and central banks from using financial repression for their own devious ends. With a currency backed even fractionally by gold, it makes it much harder for reckless money printing to increase purchasing power.
- Gold has another problem as it relates to economic growth. As an economy grows, the money supply should grow with it. If money supply is not allowed to grow in line with economic growth, you are left with one of two outcomes. Running an economy on a gold standard is like riding a bike with training wheels.
