- What I want to talk about today is really about Arbitram governance and the Dao. And I guess at the foundation, my role mostly focuses on research and education. Why are DAOs useful and why should we care about that? And finally, what's the relationship between Dao and the Arbitram Foundation as well?
- A video from 2015 shows the birth of the Arbitram protocol. Two years later, off chain labs created Arbitrum. In 2019, Barry WhiteHat released a roll up GitHub repo for simple payments. These live deployments of these networks are giving the technology away to the community.
- David Wheeler: Why should we care about DAOs in general? He says if there's only one meaningful deployment of software, who's authorized to issue an upgrade? Wheeler: Third approach is to have an explicit governance process.
- The Arbitrum Dao has two missions. The first is to defend the protocol from any malicious upgrade. The second is to have a treasury. All of the revenue from the Arbitrum network goes straight to the Dow. What explicitly could the Dow vote on?
- The Dao underpins and has the authority to upgrade most of the smart contracts that underpin Arbitrum today. All votes are cast via the Onchain Smart contracts. The Security Council has a three day window to veto a proposal.
- Onchain governance contracts work in a nutshell. If you want the nitty gritty details, you can look at Chris's diagram. This is actually a very detailed chart, but of course, it's not very welcoming.
- What proposals have people voted on for the Arbitram Dow? There was a proposal proposed by Alchemy to enable account abstraction for the sequencer. Now there's two new proposals around grants that are going through this process. We'll just have to see what happens finally.
- The Arbitram Foundation is accountable to the Dao. We are the only foundation that has a vesting contract that's under control of the Dow. When your proposal passes, we are then there to help you execute on your proposal. This is unique to cryptocurrency setups.
- Last week, the Ambassador program was released. The foundation has sponsored both Tally and off chain labs to work on an on chain election software for appointing new Security Council members. There's a second proposal where we're proposing to modify the start date of the election.
- The foundation is finally releasing their grant program. It's going to be focused on small grants for both developers and infrastructure. So hopefully everyone here can help spread the word.
