- We had 141 people registered to join in today, which is pretty sweet. While we're waiting, if you want to share the space on your Twitter, that'd be awesome. We'll see if we can crack 200.
- This is a Twitter space about leadership as leadership pertains to DAOs. What is Dow leadership? How does leadership even work in a Dow? Is it a conflict of interest to have a leader in a Dao? One way or another, we've got to find solutions.
- There's several speakers here today. We have Andrew here from Origami as a co host. I just interviewed Matt, the founder of Origami, on the Citidao Pod. Matai here from Kiftao, a fellow network state friend. I'm really curious to hear Bob's perspectives on a number of these topics.
- We have either Flex or Commodore coming from Krause house. Deeper Rocks has joined us from Impact Dows with her book on Dows. If Jordan is not here yet, then Jordan will be joining. His perspective on some of these leadership topics will be very relevant.
- Arvin is here today from sold out Secrets NFTs a champion in organizing Twitter spaces. Mel Eve is a speaker and Steve from Dow Planets or Dow Denver coming up really soon. I'll be in charge of the mute button. If things get off topic, I'll have to use that mute button again.
- So, basic rules for the space today and we go right in. Put your hand up if you want to speak. If you have a question, just click that button. No money price speculation, market talks, none of that stuff, please. This isn't a place for money, period. It's a discussion about Dow leadership.
- Does the concept of decentralization negate concept of leadership? In other words, if there are leaders in a decentralized community, does that mean that it's not decentralized anymore? What are your thoughts?
- DAOs don't have bosses, but they have leaders. And there's a clear difference between a boss and a leader. Having all leaders can lead to chaos as well. I'd love to hear your perspective on it.
- Deepak Rocks: I think there is definitely a distinction between leader and boss. Mel east: The bosses in the Dow space I believe is just the process. Have at or you got your hand up here and let's hear you can either reply directly or have your go at the answer.
- Mel, do you want to pick up on that note? And thank you for having me. I would say decentralization and leadership, I don't think they negate each other. How do you lead a group towards having a safe place for the discussion?
- DAOs as well, and Bubs, maybe if you want to take off on that note, let's hear what you have to say. I'm curious. If Denver wanted to go first, if that's okay with you.
- Steve Eckman: The difference is with Dows is anyone can be a leader. He says there's effectiveness in being able to follow and not question the chain of command. The projects that get momentum and move forward are the ones where people join in.
- Bob: I do believe that leadership negates what a Dao is. The acronym stands for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In my dow specifically, no one's a leader. Everyone kind of just does their thing. And we all play our role, support each other.
- Brains: Yes, we do have guardians. Would you call them leaders? Or where does the line between leader and Guardian? Sometimes in a decentralized organization, we need centralized aspects for the sake of management.
- The concept of a guardian to protect what it is you're trying to do and the mission of it. Who set up the guardian system initially? Was it one centralized single founder that set that up? If you have questions for any of the speakers today, note them down.
- Not everybody that joins a Dao has the leadership qualities. It's important that there are leaders identified for different work streams. Too many leaders can lead to chaos. There needs to be a way to optimize for work and decision making.
- Everyone that's listening right now, I'm curious. I'm going to ask you to put a thumbs up on the emotes here on this space. And then equally important, by a show of hearts, how many people can think of bad leadership?
- Kift is a community of digital nomads and van lifers. The company is building out a network of community hubs. Decentralization is important and leadership is even more important within that. How did you deal with when you needed to switch a leader for whatever reason?
- Anyone that's listening, if you have an example of good leadership that you've experienced in a community I'd love to hear what it is. Put your hand up and I'll put you in queue here. What is a good example of leadership?
- When it comes to leadership, it's far more than just a title in leadership, says Arvin. It's the integrity that it brings to the organization. And I don't know if decentralization is even a thing yet. But I want to hear about what people think.
- What would you say is the first step towards becoming a leader inside your organization? Just put your hand up and I'll bring you in as a speaker.
- One of my biggest concerns with funding Dows is the divisiveness and the competitiveness that that really ends up creating. It's very difficult to create a non competitive environment on a zero sum game. That's one of the things that I think we're going to see evolving over the next few years.
- There's also hidden leadership. That person who's number two in the organization, that person who gives you support. How can you create much more of a flow within your organization so that people are moving around to where they're needed most.
- Leadership is about moving the Dow forward. People said the first thing you need to do if you want to be leading in a dow is to just listen. I get really excited about dow is building more of a culture of asking for feedback and listening.
- How has your thinking on leading in dows evolved over time? And especially given the sort of depth of knowledge and practice. The interviews will be publishing results just before East Denver and sharing about it more at East Denver. Feel free to follow me or follow Talent Dow for more insights if you're interested.
- Nonviolent communication. I think of this as everything in the spirit of gift giving. Being the good leader is the way to kind of create good leadership within a dow. The idea of trust is that when I'm not looking at you, you're going to act in accordance with expectation.
- There are a lot of roles within a dow leader, guardian, stored coordinator, builder, curator. Groups of humans always need to be protected at the base layer by humans. How has your leadership, your thoughts on leadership, changed through time?
- Mel Robbins: Can you give us a quick summary of the work that you're doing? She says her thesis is that humans and technology are on a spectrum. If we work together now to solve these problems, she says, we can shave thousands of years off of humanity's journey. Robbins: I just really hope that we kind of create the mechanism to do it peacefully together.
- Tessa Fila: I came from traditional Web Two. From there, I made the logical jump into construction. In 2015, we almost went bankrupt. When I move over to Web Three, I ask myself how much of that is applicable? How much of it is not applicable?
- Tessa: For Dows to scale outside of this team of explorers, having tangible documentation around how to contribute and what kind of things are valuable in a Dow. For anyone thinking about launching a Dao, definitely reach out to Starpause and origami.
- A lot of my experience with leadership just in general, has been more in the web two space. I think personally, everything rises and falls on leadership, and it's extremely important to have the right leaders in place. Leadership is an extremely selfless thing if it's done right.
- The most important thing there to me is the serving part and servant leadership is real leadership. Trying to always go with that service mindset and what you can do to impact and grow other people is a huge thing to hang your hat on as a leader.
- One of the things that really stood out to me in the web two world was to lead by example. To me personally I find it very difficult to subordinate myself. If you have a different perspective or an add on to that, just raise your hand and I'll add you into the speaking queue.
- Dowplanet. org would love to host you at Dow Denver. I think IRL events are really like the great necessity. They're really a necessity for growing strong teams to occasionally get together in real life. Hope people can make it to ETH Denver.
- The best leaders are usually the best followers. How do you develop leaders within a dao? It's pretty organic within Dow planet. It's the people who consistently show up and provide valuable contribution. I invite everybody to follow us.
- Next up on the speaking platform is Shlomo. He does a lot of consulting for Dow Governance, especially in the social impact space. How could you collectivize each other and funnel money to important causes?
- Lomo: Should it be a decentralized leadership structure or not? Lomo: One main thing leadership is about is safe curation of ideas and moments. Next up is Timed. Then Andrew, Cameron and Matai, just feel free to put your hand back up and chime in.
- Timed has been doing this for over three years now in web three. I like e Denver for the ability to know that not only are they having that community that bonding, but they're also creating a hackathon. Do you want to attend Quantum Miami in Miami?
- Think of the last time you saw what could be defined as a toxic conversation. How do you resolve a toxic online, typed based conversation? If you have an answer to that or an experience you want to share with that, I'd love to hear it.
- Andrew Keen: It seems like real leadership is including the other members of the Dao. Keen: People are going to see right through shammable leadership and they're going to walk out and bail. And we need long term Dow. Next up is Cameron, if you want to pick up on that Note.
- In some cases, there is a take advantage, let's fake lead people to take advantage of what our own personal agendas are. If you want to go a different direction, it's up to you.
- The culture of collaboration in Web Three is one of my favorite elements. How awesome would it be if there was a tax dow that would help all these other dows and their members run their taxes? I see massive waves of momentum happening when people come together in real life.
- Next up, we have Bubs come on in and join the chat again. We're going to build on these topics to summarize everything that's being talked about. We have a code of conduct where everybody just holds ourselves to a certain standard. And maybe Bubs, if you felt like chiming in and sharing some notes.
- The consensus from our discord is that we aren't going to enforce it via punishment. Usually if someone has done wrong in our Dao, a general consensus of the people agree. Nothing has been enforced in terms of retribution or anything like that. We're still exploring and growing.
- Kift is piloting what it means to come together and collaborate as a community. We also host weekly house meetings for our people living together on site. The first things we kick off house meetings with are clearings. From props we move into the agenda where we deep dive on any topics that need broader solutioning.
- Arvin, I know that you have probably bumped into a few times, like we talked about earlier in this space. To say is fake leadership to try and manipulate an outcome for self purposes and how do you deal with that? Arvin, if you want to chime in, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
- Arbin: What leaves people with is actually like actions and how life is. It's not just all about responding to stupid stuff online. What would be really cool is maybe us just really be conscious on how much of it we can handle. The next space is February 1.
- Lona: I wanted to ask if you've come across a book called The Advantage by Patrick Lencioni. One of the things that I learned from it was that conflict should actually be encouraged in a healthy team. Next space will be February 1, 11:00 a. m. Mountain time.
- Al: I'm truly powered by gratitude these days and my own. I would love to basically highlight or just invite people to look into that set of resources as a model for how an organization of hundreds of thousands of people coordinate. We'll see you February 1 11:00, a. m. Mountain time.
