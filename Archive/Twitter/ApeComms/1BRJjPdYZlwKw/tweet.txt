- Today is just a combo space with the Apecoms crew and the ladies of Buc crew. SSP and Aventurus are also with us. Let's look around the audience and see who's actually here. Lorelord Peak, Lore Popple, Snowflake, and Toby, please request, if you just want to make it a little easier for us.
- What type of initiatives do you hope to support? I know you spoke about collaborating sort of directly with Yuga. But I think the priority should be experiment within the other side first to fully support.
- The difference is going to be that in other side and similar meta verses, we are going to own the assets. So we are already there, but it will emerge, it will change in nature. We should definitely be the ones who define how it's going to move forward.
- If possible, I would invite the members. Let's meet up in real life. I can organize something in Istanbul. It should focus on the other side first, and then we will move on.
- How would you imagine putting a team together to support this vision? And how do you imagine supporting them in executing the vision? We'll definitely reach out to the ape community first.
- Here you metaverse steward nominees and potential candidates. There are also aips up for vote. Our community hour tomorrow at noon PST. We're going to be announcing some stuff this week in support of the election coverage.
