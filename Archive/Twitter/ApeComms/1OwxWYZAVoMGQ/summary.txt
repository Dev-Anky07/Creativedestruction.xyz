- Hello everybody. We are here to talk about coin dow's Ape Chain. Anybody that would like to be part of the discussion or have questions, go ahead and request Lumberg. Let me know if I've missed anybody here.
- Shout out board. Ape gazette. I see Balu lost board. The one I voted against but still I didn't vote. Anyways. Shout out to poor Ape Gazette. What else do we got in the house?
- Lumberg: This is the next natural progression how Ape chain can and should be launched as the best NFT trading and the best gaming chain out there. As this post is in the AIP idea stage, we're definitely doing this to solicit feedback before we put forth an official AIP proposal.
- HN: Building a whole chain is not something that's just a technology solely endeavor. You still need the community, you need the businesses to build on top of it. It's way too early to tell what's going to happen with NFTs.
- Ape chain is going to be a core contributor to optimism. All the optimism chains have some kind of opt in yield it doesn't have to be everybody's forced to do it. We could even build in features where you decide where you want to stake it.
- Jackie: I've been building my own version of Other Side. We meet in a swamp and can see each other as the 3d Avatars. Op stack is fully open source and maintained by a quite enthusiastic community. I will throw out my challenges to the team and to see how we can improve.
-  Indigo is one of the technical advisors on the project. He leans towards the optimism and Arbitram stacks. The more important part of this proposal is not necessarily the underlying chain stack. It's more of what the community brings as far as protocols.
- Foley: My focus in crypto is primarily around token mechanisms, incentive design. The incentives behind the chain can actually create a community with actual projects. And I feel like that's something that's neglected where people focus so much on chains just being the product.
- Jimmy: Board apes are like the poster child of NFTs. And I think that the choice that we made with Op is actually very fitting to this. It embodies the same values. I think the best part is it really emphasizes how with crypto, we can't just have tech. We need more, we need social.
- Nick is currently working on Wallet and Stops and application level development. Previously, he was working on protocol layer stuff at the Ethereum Foundation. One promising aspect of the optimism is their modularity, which would enable Apechain to pivot to validity proof ZK proof in the future.
- Bradley zestro, co founder of X Marketplace, also previously with Dash as far as Web Three experience. His thesis is really around building out that partnerships across five different pillars. Be sure to keep your questions relevant to the topic here.
- We've been on multiple calls with different chains. Everybody was supportive. No one was not supportive. Everybody wanted us to use Apain. We spoke with everybody and I think we've made a good choice. Picking this part next is a long road and it's going to be exciting.
- Awesome. So we got two folks with questions here. Let's start with big bowl. If you can't get up on stage, go ahead and leave it in the comments.
- Our preference right now is to have the Ape chain token. It creates a self sustainability because without Ape, there's no way to fund this project. Blast is controversial, but the idea around having a separate token to that, does it help or hurt blur?
- Ape chain will be launching with more than just a proxy to a SIG. There are a lot of costs associated with launching a layer two. With Blast, my hopes are high and I feel we're going to do well again with the AC token.
- If you go the AC token route, would you even need an AIP from the Dow. Alternatively this brings up the whole RFP thing. How are we going to put together a team to even field an RFP?
- The actual design for the token is not finalized. The priority is to ensure that we have efficient use of the sequencer. The real job is to create a vibrant chain with a lot of usage bootstrapped with products and protocols and services.
- If an AC token exists, it should be used to make sure that those sequencer fees are being collected. I don't think the AC token will be something that replaces Ape but rather works in coordination with Ape, but specifically focused on the niche of the chain.
- Derek Smart has posted some things that are critical of the process itself. Let's also please do keep it respectful for all. I'm not critical of this at all, I think it's an excellent idea. Can you hear me?
- I was a little concerned regarding how this is going to get funded. I think funding it through a token is a good idea. Would you guys be releasing the white paper for publicly releasing the chain itself? And then I think the second part of the question was, is it governed by Apecoin?
- So we do have Benji here from Optimism. Just I think it's good for him to say hi. And always open to answer any questions on the Op labs end. GM super excited to see all this. Take more questions and even a team want to say anything.
- L Two S has much higher transaction throughput it's much cheaper. That makes it ideal for web three gaming, but also for payment solutions. I was wondering if it would be an idea to create grants or incentives for the Made By Apes. I'm just curious if any of this would be worth exploring.
- Two questions here mainly one is around ecosystem funding, and second is around staking. The intent here being a gaming and NFT chain for Apechain is for the Staking to then be able to help distribute to the stakeholders and people users of AC governance tokens.
- Ape Chain does this thing called retroactive public goods funding. People from Base can easily just play a game on Ape chain vice versa. You get end to end customization for your chain. We also do a lot of different collaborative events. It's like we can kind of bring the masses together.
- The new chain could read any token holding of any wallet and based on that, grant the staking rewards or whatever. We'd have probably a. Broad program initial program that you bring your DApps over. Depending on TVL and transactions, you would get reward accordingly.
- Ape Chain was originally proposed by Yuga in response to the other side mint. Will the network be able to hold a large volume of activity over a very short period of time? And then secondarily to that is the ecosystem funding we talked about.
- On a similar note, I was wondering about what the minimum amount of fees on the networks would be because again, it is tied to the Ethereum main net. These layer two roll ups, including this final choice of optimism, is still the right path.
- In a perfect world, where are we at? What kind of timeline are you guys looking at? And then also, do we have a list of DApps that we're looking at that we want to deploy immediately on the chain? Once we get those timelines, man, it's off to the races.
- Right now there's really no use for it. Apecoin doesn't even have a use right now. Where do we expect to get all this volume to come in from? Who's going to use Ape chain and what for?
- "I've been pretty vocal about it and why I think there are definitely better ways to go about our Ape Chain " Yuga needs to confirm that they want to use it, then yeah, this sounds like it could eventually reach sustainability. With new people being elected, isn't there like a handover coming soon?
- I doubt any of those $500 million will actually be used on the chain. Everybody's hoping to pull it right back out in February when they unlock it. And they just want that AirDrop.
- There's hundreds of millions of dollars sitting in the treasury of this chain. I don't think the chain dies just because Yuga says they're not interested. Voters voting for trash is a people issue. We need to bring in revenue.
- Today is the ape point. Ape Chain eight team research, deploy and manage. There's a lot of people on the team. Reach out to them individually. Go after Lumberg. Talk to Bradley.
- The topic here on Ape chain, ape team on the forum, it's closing. The discussion is closing in two days. Do feel free to drop any more thoughts or questions there on the discourse forum. Perhaps we'll do another space to address any outstanding questions before post the official AIP proposal.
