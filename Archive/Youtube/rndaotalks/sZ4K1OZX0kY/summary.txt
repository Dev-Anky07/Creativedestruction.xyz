- Matt Barney is an expert in psychometrics and been going down the rabbit hole of risk management. He has kindly offered to give us a talk on some of his work. Thank you for being with us.
- Why should we care about enterprise risks? How might we think about what's similar about other organizations and the science around them? If we're going to do good science around Dows, what kinds of things we need to worry about? Feel free to challenge or ask clarifying questions anytime.
- The biggest sources of risk to achieving goals is bottlenecks. This way of thinking about organizational effectiveness across disciplines challenges the traditional way we think about an organizational structure. It suggests that we should flip our organizational structures upside down to, say, every support process.
- More important in DAOs than in a traditional organization is persuasion. Since before Bitcoin Pizza day people were trying to persuade people to use crypto. Library may be shut down by the SEC as a warning sign to the industry.
- There are many complicated persuasion areas and there's good science in this. All of them are very relevant to DAOs and convincing people to fund your science. The first three are about cultivating relationships. The second two about reducing uncertainty. The last two are about motivating action.
- A psychometric NFT or a psychometric set of smart contracts could help mitigate the risk of, say, dao founders or dao governance types being able to move the Dao community. Most social science measurement are not useful. We need to trust the measurements to test our scientific theories, but also to make good decisions in Dows.
- Roche measures performance of a coach long after coaching is over from the point of view of the client who consumed the coaching. Roche is unique in that it separates quantitatively and objectively measures of the person in the Dao. It removes the different kinds of biases.
- There are many aspects that DAOs have not always been robust to risks. How do we make them more antifragile? It's not obvious how to do it. To test good hypotheses in any science, including Dows, we need good instruments.
- There's so much exciting potential for DAOs, so much we don't know. We need good measurements, and there's a family of those in social science. What I'm envisioning to make the science go better is a kind of transparent immutable psychometrics. It can be a real renaissance for Dows.
- Daniel: I see some very interesting potential on this. We just need to start bringing it down to the super concrete use cases. The idea around contributor reputation and building that trust is a huge component of what I'm focused on right now. Look forward to continue the discussion.
- It's hard to establish trust when you don't know if somebody is just LARPing in that role. If you abandon that halfway through, then it's now a leaderless project that's going nowhere. There's a lot that the persuasion science has to say about how do you get them to make a commitment.
- There's no way of verifying someone's skill set without taking away that anonymity. High quality contributors are hesitant to get involved in Dows because they have no security that their work will actually go somewhere. What I'm envisioning is a much more trustworthy set of information.
- The composable, the immutable composable measures. Vitalik is now much more of in the persuasion space than he is in the Solidity programming space. Wouldn't it be nice in Dao risk management if part of our Dao wants to look after the development of senior leaders like Vitalik.
- Kadaki: My vision for the Dow world and Web Three is to also have hooks into Web two in things like Microsoft Azure. How do we help business leaders think about the future of all of this? And I would love to continue this conversation and keep thinking about this.
