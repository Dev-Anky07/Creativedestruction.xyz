- SA. It's don't. Let me manually fade out this pirate jam. Do you have the YouTube stream? No, I have the browser muted. My bad. I thought it was coming through. You know what I mean?
- Eli: The show is called Players going to Play. We bring Arbitrum game onto the stream and some team members. We just play through the game and have some fun. This is our second live stream, I believe. I'm curious to see where everything is at now.
- DIPH runs business development at Proof of Play. Has hundreds of games on Steam and on his mobile. Long time coming for him to finally work on a game. Who's next? Board, your pick.
- Bordeaux Musk spent over ten years in the video game industry. He is launching a new venture called Edison, a partnership with Improbable. Apex and Sobi might make an appearance, and who knows who else promised to show up.
- We had feedback from auditors about the starting volume of the game. When you sign into the game, we want your whole household to hear that you're playing Fire Nation. We can reduce that volume if it's a little bit overpowering on the stream.
- There's actually a hidden parkour achievement in Pirate Nation. One quest gives you 125 XP once per day. The combat is where the game shines. But leveling up is an important piece of that.
- It's called Pirate Nation main theme. The chap who composed the tune is OG. Every week something has been shipped. It's already kind of come a long way from launch day. A lot of stuff in the game has just been vastly improved.
- With Gotcha, I think that it's always a balance between luck and skill. Perfect for a game like this is like 80% strategic decisions and 20% luck. You have to set goals around those kind of mechanics and design from those first principles.
- We printed out all of the Pirate Nation cards in combat and we're playing them as a physical card game together. I could see being a board game in 2025. That's like a fun year three holiday thing.
- To win an exciting prize, you need a copper coin. Toss your coin into the wishing well. Where can people get the copper coins? There's a number of ways.
- Apex: One of the things I really like that we got in the game is this predictive UI. It's something that makes the game feel so smooth while transactions are happening on Chain.
- If you have two pirates, you still only have 150 energy a day. There's a way you can get energy back by actually collecting using run. Balance of this is intentional to make the game feel palatable enjoyable.
- If you're posting from a ship, is it ship posting? Exactly? I believe it is ship posting. It's been nice having you, though. See you later.
- There's quite a lot of cool stuff coming on the ship front. A bunch has already been obviously shared with the community. People are going to care a lot about their ships, I think, pretty soon.
- The things that you would want to consider as you go into combat are, in particular, your affinity and your expertise. When you hit 40 plus cards in your deck, you are able to customize it. I would just go straight into battle and see how you do.
- The combat has really evolved nicely over the last few months. You can also take actions predicting what your opponents are going to do. The game was streamed four months ago. It allows you to control the pace of the game a little bit by cycling your deck faster.
- When my deck runs out, does it shuffle back in? Yes. There are cards that will also shuffle for you as well. But presents are for me, I would probably double spam those boards.
- You lean towards attacking more versus fortifying more in Pirate Nation. I usually just try to kill the small ships first and then deal with the rest afterwards. Honestly, it seems like a pretty good strat as far as damage pirates go.
- At every command rank you gain a bunch of items for players that are newer to the game. Playing a month gets you to command rank ten. At command rank Ten for new players that unlocks their account to be able to export items.
- Okay. I'm starting to become familiar with the icons pretty quick. Is every gauntlet five? Yeah. Some can go less, some can go more, only more. I am about to win and go into Battle five, so I can show that off.
- We are going to give away a Warren Copper coin and a code in our discord. At the end of the stream, we'll pick someone who's watching to get a coin. Pirates are still for sale, right? The founders pirates are freely transferable on market, but we're not minting them.
-  Founders Pirates were the first entry into the game. They look way more visually diverse. Are the individual pirates, like, full 3D files, like GLBs or whatever? They're available now to just download from the Pirate page on our website.
- Apex, it looks like you're pretty far along based on your inventory. How are you finding the Gauntlets in general? I usually just play them until Max CP because I want to loot. Give me some lessons too. These aren't that easy, these final battles.
- The Open seas marketplaces are all being updated right now. Some of the battles are pretty tough if you don't have the right expertise. Sometimes you get unlucky cards. Especially on a skiff.
- Double Strike in particular is one of my favorite cards. It just feels pretty nice because then also I got a little bit of couple of licks in on the benches. I'll say it it's a little too easy.
- Double Strike is one of my favorites. It depends on the expertise, though. If you hold shift, you don't have to double click. You can just play the cards.
- The level cap on pirates is currently 30. If we start seeing that virtually all of the pirates are level 30, it'll make sense at some point to increase the level cap. We just want to do it mindfully.
- You can place basically anything that's in your inventory, even if it's a functional item. Items that you have will be placeable. And then there's some things that you can do to stack. Some of these also give you, by placing them on your island, like you get some rum every day.
- You can visit other people's islands. There is a button that you click this, it brings you into a version of the game that is their island. We also have active game competitions. What's some of your favorite islands?
- We launched starter islands months ago, and we have kind of been focused on other features. Where we're heading in the future is to a place where people will have more ways of showing off their islands. islands are going to be a much bigger deal down the line.
- You can use code boardbox on piratenation gameplay to get into Pirate Nation. Mint a Gen one that is five times use. Pick someone in chat to win a Warren Copper coin.
- What day did pirate nation officially migrate to Arbitram? First person to answer that in the chat will win.
- The winner of the free code giveaway has been revealed. The code has seven uses. Here's how to post it on YouTube. If the code board box isn't working, it probably means that it was used up.
- If you get in through this, of course, shout out on Twitter. Tag us on Pirate Nation. I still have to finish this gauntlet. After the stream, I think I can make it to all five battles.
- The person who won on YouTube is one of our Russian mods. It's been cool to see the game become much more internationally played. Let us know when you DM the Pirate Nation account. If you don't have a pirate, we'll get you one.
- Matt: Thanks for joining. And we had a really good turnout today. We've converted a lot of Arbanauts to pirates. Arbitram is great. If you haven't even tried it yet, give it a try.
- Eli: We have some awesome things coming this week. One of them is addressing session length in the game. The theme is balance, and we're going to be listening with a very open mind. Most of the people who claim the code are having trouble. Submit a ticket and our team will help out.
