- Acom: Do you want to hear I got this whole list of copyright music? If it's copyright free, then go right ahead and play it. Just don't get us bonked by the basically the copyright association. But do it.
- Play Apecoin soundtrack. We'll give it like less than a minute. We're going to see how it feels, see how people feel about it. It now I can't even hear it. Why can't I hear it?
- Apecoin is well past number 52, well over a year into these stages. We're also working on delivering some special election coverage and supporting some other content creators in the ecosystem. A lot of fun, a lot of serious work behind the scenes to be done.
- Coffee with Captain features an informal group of members of the Apecoin community. They talk about why the elections are important and what the purpose of working groups is. Steve: It seems like two weeks ago is when we should have started some of this conversation.
- SSP: I figured out the hidden Setting, but now I'm concerned that it might be too loud. How's the volume? That's pretty good. We can do some of that stuff behind the scenes. So find the right soundtrack for your disclaimer.
- Good morning. Good afternoon. How are you doing over there? Hi. It's actually the evening here in France. Still lost here behind the Apecom's account. We'll definitely give Dim his time.
- Aaron: TFG is here who is also running for Metaverse, Stewart. I was giving him the big tour. I won't talk about my special counsel run until next week. Who's running us up? The whole crew is here. Tis the season.
- Since I joined last time, I've seen a huge improvement in the Dao. Instagram is one of the platforms that is not being looked after. I cannot wait to see huge collaborations in 2024. Huge congratulations and best of luck to all the nominees.
- So thank you for giving my time and I'm going to sleep. It's actually very late. Appreciate you coming up and being with us so early. Or late. Let's just get through five minutes of some of these questions.
- What inspired you to run for the stewardship position of the Metaverse Working Group? I think we are in a pivotal moment for the Dao. We need to go and get the builders. I've been crypto for ten years in NFT for the past, since 2019, 2020. I'm full time now since June 2022.
- The main goal is to be the backbone of Web Three. The other point that I would love with this group, one of this goal would be IRL. There is still 0% of Apecoin. This is something that needs to be changed.
- We're going to limit all of the responses in total to five minutes. What does this mean? Identities, right? Interoperable about identities. Are they sharing? Do they mean to share? I don't know. You guys got to figure this out.
- What do you think makes the Metaverse Working Group worth being funded by the Dow? Please? We are in a pivotal moment, and we can't just wait for people to come with their project and ask for funding. We need to bring people to the Dow.
- What sort of a budget do you think is needed to get all of this done and just to quantify it. It will include obviously the budget for IRL events. What if basically the Metaverse working room is actually issuing some kind of grant. It's not something that can be done.
- What sort of initiatives do you hope to see supported through the Metaverse working group? Smaller things, maybe medium sized things too, maybe it's bigger things, I don't know. But I think the rich we can accomplish so much even with a tiny budget, that's for sure.
- Uzi: We've got more proposals up to vote, more ideas in the process. Would you want to keep them fresh, keep them in the discussion? If everyone can implement what they promised, I think we'll be in a much, much better place.
- Daniel: I'm in Lisbon tonight. Congrats on the proposal and excited to share it at some point. Who do we got? What's up, Lost? GM.
- Apecoms has made such a long time is felt, from my perspective, all members of the Dow. We really appreciate all the trust you guys are giving us and we're looking forward to delivering on what's in that proposal. Going to be exciting.
- Good morning. Appreciate the spaces that you guys did yesterday as well. Tiger, every time you come up on stage, you're building your brand. Next time you see Tiger on the timeline, just know she'll shut you right down.
- "How can we get that consistency and harness this throughout the entirety of 2024? " "I know the answer, but I can't say it until after the election is over " "We're going to ride this cliff until 2024 "
- We have this discussion every election cycle. Everybody's interested, everybody's in the discussion. And then like, two months, two and a half months later, nothing. This is going to be potentially our third time unless we've solved it.
- One of our Apecoms team members currently one of the governance stewards currently in the incumbent election. Double first. Amp how's it feel? It feels great. And it's really cool to see all the interested people short and sweet today.
- SSP ape chain is definitely one of the current discussions. But maybe we'll have an election chain, too. One of the proposals that was put into process was withdrawn and removed from the AIP process. There are now just the two Ape chain proposals.
- If you have an idea for an Ape chain, don't hesitate to start the AIP process on the Apecoms forum. Don't be afraid to use that forum to discuss your ideas with people. There is no shortage of ideas in process, though, so keep them coming.
- It looks like we ended up with several Staking proposals. Maybe the Ape chain discussion and the Staking discussion are related. It's going to take a few years for any sort of an ape chain product to be delivered. At the end of the day, Friday, community hour, everybody, please hit it.
- Mochaverse Tweeted that they're increasing the allocation of ape to the Mochaverse community up to 6 million. What are the pros and cons of this? This is just the dow in its infancy growing. An AIP is snaking through the system that might address voting.
- How do we get more small delegates growing? Sometimes delegations don't work. How can we truly become the kind of culture with the entire sort of Web Three user base behind it. And how do we solve this problem?
- What if the delegate just wants to change their wallet? What if their wallet gets hacked? It's just another one of those kinks in the whole process that we should be looking to make easier for people.
- Some automations can be put in place. For example, you can pick a different delegate depending on which type of proposal it is. If a delegate becomes inactive, there is some automation for that as well. If we wanted to get into really custom levels of voting and automation it might require that we go away from snapshot.
- Any increase in participation in apecoin dow or another dow is a net positive. Every time there's an increase in votes it triggers a certain group of people to get frustrated or inspired to come out and do something about it.
- There's frustration and complaining about it or there's working together towards a solution. Any increase in participation is a good thing and it's up to us to navigate through that. I really encourage that discussion, by the way, talking about getting more participation.
- This is Apecoms community hour. Every Friday we run apecoms monday, Wednesday, Friday at noon pacific. Community hour can sometimes go a bit longer than usual. Not everything gets sorted out here but it's good to have the conversations.
- I don't actually have much to say about the delegations. I'm actually in this position of learning, listening to everybody and just kind of finding my own lane. It's a big responsibility. But that's just my personal perspective.
- Apecoin token delegation lost Hodler Collective has 131,000. I should have just said delegate. It's just great to hear some of this stuff I don't have one way or the other. I think everything is just difficult to navigate.
- I don't think that there's any sort of silver bullet. It's probably going to be multiple levers as far as how or if we wanted to address any of that. So I think it's worthwhile, I think, lost.
- Bradley: The Ve or Vote Escrowed model is a great model, I think, to explore. Skin in the game can also be defined as a function of both that value as well as how long you've held it. There's debate as to what sort of that locking or voting power model looks like.
- DeFi: I am 100% for more delegations. We need to reach out to more communities and make stuff happen. Vote Escrow makes a little bit more sense in our Dow. There needs to be a naturally aligned incentive for users to want to lock their tokens.
- Aaron: To get any of these things through, you're going to have to convince the large delegations to give up their power. Machi has signaled that if it was something like staking or beneficial that he might think about it. But ultimately, these things have to be voted by AIP.
- The official forum was discussing the financial capital versus social capital. Have you put up an AIP? Has your AIP passed basically creating an algorithm of what is social capital value. I think we're a long way away from the Apecoin dow to get XP points for voting.
- Even on discourse we do have like an automatic translator. There is a setting at least that you can turn on and then the translation will take place. All of the built in options and functions of the discourse platform can be in the native language.
- I got spooky sounds. You want me to give, like, negative feedback on who was it? Meme brains. You can record some yourself. You'll get some good ones going. We're going to hide my trick.
- Big Bull needs to release an audiobook on how to speak properly. An Apes Guide to Being Posh. When the book drops, I'm listening to it to help me lull myself to sleep. We need to get Lord onto some comedy clubs. I want to hear you speak Chinese.
- Election season. You can vote for the metaverse working group stewards. There's three AIPS up for vote as well this week. One proposal would allow proposals to continue to go up during the election process. Those elections start next week.
- Daniel: Vankape was created with a really simple idea in mind. People deserve to be rewarded for the contributions that we make to this Dao. Over 2000 contributors to Bank Ape, over 10,000 contributions. We've funded over 233 projects from a lot of the people that you know in the Dow. We're actively soliciting feedback now.
- The Dow had more than a billion dollars in Apecoin to incentivize top talent to contribute value. Phase Two is basically addressing the same problem that continues to be the biggest problem the Dow. How do we create value? Efficiency utility now.
- How many beers did you buy with your grant? None, because I haven't been paid for it yet. We fund when it's been demonstrated that value is contributed. There is a process around that and that's valuable for the Dow.
- Big bowl was one of the recipients of a grant through the thank Ape prop house system. Not everyone should be attempting to go and get a benefit in the same way in the ecosystem. I think this thencape addresses that, finding a place for everyone to thrive.
- Ape Do would like to see thank Ape Do events like summer camp where every single person or as many as we can just sort of gets voted and attributed some kind of award. There are various ways to share it with the community but also with the board as well.
- The Bay apes got something cooking. Your mic sounds tight dog. G dude, you can make it out of foam core and a printer and some glue gun. We're going to have to find funding.
- Uzi says one person can change the sentiment of a big delegate or a big delegation. You don't need 10 million ape coins to make a difference if you have that one voice, that one mic and really getting your message out there. He says as long as it's not broken we don't try and fix it.
- The word grant for me is almost know. You don't really expect value because it's given. Ultimately what we expect from people in the know when we give them these funds is that those proposals need to create value for the Apecoin community. Is there any mileage in us thinking about changing the language?
- When it comes to bend out, having our toe, can stake them, being able to vote, how does that work? To the best of my knowledge, you don't have to do anything extra. Thank you to everyone involved in putting that together.
- On the 9 November, there was Apecoin Dow official post on X which talked about saying that you can put forward proposals which are going to give financial contribution back to the Dow. Language is definitely important. People will think about words differently. If I do get elected, I think that'll be something I look to do pretty quickly.
- All right. What's up? You think about anything? I want to throw your thoughts in on any of the things we're discussing. I love hearing different people's perspectives on. This is community hour, so I'm letting one to hear what everyone else it love it.
- Semantics is always important. I would just like the community to maybe talking about semantics and even mindset is not necessarily think of the Dow as a startup. The Dow can basically help and promote and support and fund hundreds of startups within the ecosystem.
- Apecoin Dow isn't just a VC fund, period. We are trying to be the Dow of culture through entertainment, events, gaming, art. We should also bring in artists and other folks that have lifestyle brands. If we can get something like that in place, I would love that.
- Snowflake: I'm thinking now maybe I should put options instead of like yes or no. We're working on education and we keep working on bringing people into the blockchain and Dows. And we want the Apecoin to be featured as one of the main topics.
- Bojangles: I would love to see the Dow do more when it comes to charitable work. What is a grant? SSP: If we know that we have X amount of dollars as a Dow set aside for these various things, maybe that makes it easier.
- The best way to increase the charitable contribution would be to fund the ecosystem. The easiest way to fund more charity is to make the ecosystem more valuable. Each payment that they get is worth more.
- Avecom's Popul is looking at the voting process for these elections. People can put their names up for multiple roles. One person should be able to run several roles up until the point we get somebody to run all of the roles. If you have any suggestions about this, let me know.
- Ajaz: Communication, the good communication with Hrs committee. PR is a huge missing element. It could definitely use more highlighting in the ecosystem for different people. Looking forward to seeing you and more of the stages.
- The initial spirit of the Dao is to fund the new, the weird and the hard. A lot of that comes down to artistic things. Not everything needs to be funded, but you cannot look past the arts. If you do it's at the peril of the Dow.
- Aaron Carroll: If I get elected to special counsel, I do not guarantee that I will sign the current NDA. Sometimes you just got to be compliant, he says. Carroll: Transparency is key and it has to be weighed with security.
- There is definitely a place for an NDA, especially in our murky legal framework here in the United States with the SEC. Board members have been too constricted in what they can say. The deal is on the table. Sometimes you just got to be compliant.
- I think more proposals we want to see is looking for game builders who are already gaming in games that people already are know. We want to get this coin out to more people and not feel like it's just exclusive right to this club. To do that, it's going to take outsiders coming in and then bringing other communities in.
- Fan: More builders building constantly. We need apekin NFTs. Can get you into your game and maybe we can sponsor you for get an ape coin. We just need to really explain them.
- Aaron: The purpose of having lawyers at all is to help us be more successful. He says when you get big and successful, you get attacked. Aaron: I encourage other authors to keep the discussion collaborative. We want Apecoin to succeed.
- Board members say lawyers have been too adversarial with the AIP authors. While what I'm saying sounds adversarial, it's not. It's working with lawyers. It means that the lawyers should be there to protect and advise, but not to run the Dow.
- SSP: If we're going to be boomer radio, somebody's got to hold it down for us. Working group zero were not hard to work with at all. I think it's just maybe getting the right language. I was hoping for a bit more election talk as well, but today's committee hour.
- "I just wanted to say some nice things as we wound out. It's community hour. And just give flowers to those people that said, if you're one of these people in the race, don't ascribe intent " "Shout out to all those people for voting "
- I would love to have some kind of official position at least like minimum supporting me in some way so I can keep doing it in more official capacity. Most likely I'm really going strong onto obviously communication in any kind of promotion ways. New elections starting next week for governance and for the special council members.
- Vulcan working with Brazy on a calendar and SSP is helping out. Will include content from all of the different content creators who are hosting election content. No, I'm not sending out no physical calendars. That'll be next year.
