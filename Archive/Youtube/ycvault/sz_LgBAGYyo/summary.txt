- How do we make things that has a passionate user base that our users are unconditionally? We're going to go over tons of information. Try not to take too many notes. Mostly just try to listen.
- Growth is the interaction between two variables, conversion rate and churn. At a startup, when you're interacting with your users, you have a fairly intimate interaction. How does real relationship work in the real world and how can we apply them to our business?
- First impressions are important for the starting of any relationship. Human beings are relationship manufacturing creatures. First time interactions means that the threshold is so much lower in terms of pass fail. People who are very good at product discover so many other first moments and make those something memorable.
- Stripe's UX is actually just documentation. There's opportunities even in documentation, sort of the enchantment amaze. When Wufu wanted to launch the third version of their API, they had over 25 applications created. How we fight, even in a short term period, can indicate the whole system.
- Criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. These are some of the biggest causes of churn in the early stages of startups. At Wufu, we constantly did experiments around support. One of the interesting byproducts was that people started being nicer to us in customer support.
- Wufu. com founder: We would write simple handwritten thank you cards to our users. He says this practice allowed the company to scale, keep the company small and have an awesome culture. The most talked about feature at Wufu was the Woofo Alert System.
- Wufu's number one focus is make it as easy to use as possible. How do you balance product development with other skills like marketing and branding? Word of mouth growth is the easiest kind of growth.
- Woofu held a King for a Day where someone randomly in the company got drawn and they got to be the king. The king got to tell everyone else what to do on the product. It was a huge hit, and it was a boost to morale.
- Wufu all work from home. How did you make that work? Remote working is especially tricky. An office gives you a lot of benefits and efficiencies. But remote working also has these other sort of efficiencies in place. But it takes extra work to make remote working happen.
- How did you instill a company culture and also have accountability for your employees? The only thing that we had for helping people manage sort of their projects is to do lists. And for people who are excellent at what they do, it works very, very well. When you actually have problems, it's very easy to fire people.
- How do you hire people that can work remotely and then sort of work in this sort of fashion? You have them work on a side project for you, so you contract them out and they have to work remotely as such. The other thing we had to sort of screen them for is their ability to do customer supports.
- Have all these tricks and experiments to help the company. Are there any ones that didn't work out? Give me stories.
- Kevin: One of the things that we did early on to try to motivate ourselves was try to get we understood this idea of crunch mode. In a company where you need everyone doing customer support, you don't have time for recovery. We decided to build like a company vacation into how Wufu works to reward our users every single year.
