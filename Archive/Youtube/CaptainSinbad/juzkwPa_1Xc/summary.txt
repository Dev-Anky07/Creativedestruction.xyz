- This is a video about how to make the next 100 days in your life the best days ever. It's going to be amazing, but it's long enough where you actually start to get meaningful results. We're actually going to crush it in the next100 days.
- The first idea is that you should make every single day exactly the same. What matters more is the schedule you set for yourself. You don't question your schedule for your 100 days. After the 100 days are up, maybe you can reevaluate, maybe something needs to be changed.
- Alex Hermosi invented the concept called robot mode. Tell yourself you're a robot, and just do the schedule no matter what. He believes in listening to your instincts.
- Captain's in Bed YouTuber Group Coaching Academy. Small cohort of students on a mission to gain 100,000 subscribers on YouTube in a year. Academy focuses on monetization, building a business back end. If you think you're willing to put in the work to grow, you can apply for the Academy.
- You should get to 80%, maybe 90% at most of the work you're trying to do, and then just stop. This way the overall volume of work I'm able to do is so much higher. For instance, with deep work, I only do 3 hours of deep work a day.
- The highlight of the day is a concept from the book Make Time. Just pick one thing, like one thing that you can do in a reasonable amount of time. Let nothing stop you from completing the highlights of your day.
