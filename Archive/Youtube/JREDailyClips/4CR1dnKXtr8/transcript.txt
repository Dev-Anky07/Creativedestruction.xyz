If he really did all the things he's saying, I hope that gets proven in court, and I hope he gets punished. If he really did that, if he didn't do that, I hope he gets exonerated. I know a lot of what he does is theater. He plays the role of this boastful misogynist who smokes cigars and drives Lamborghini, and that's his thing. And because of that, he's amassed an amazing amount of money. And he's done it by doing this character, this online persona, but then also says very wise things. He's a very smart guy. If you listen to him being interviewed by Patrick Bette, David, they talk for hours and you get to see this is a very intelligent and calculated guy. You might not agree with all the crazy antics, but you cannot deny that that's been incredibly successful because it resonates with a lot of young men who don't feel represented in the media.
