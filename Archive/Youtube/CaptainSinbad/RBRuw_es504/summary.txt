- This season, the word that has been on my mind and resonating with me a lot is potency. Potency is not just having momentum. It also means that the stuff you do, the things you take on, they bend to your will. In this video, I cover a handful of principles related to how to be as potent as possible.
- On the topic of energetic potency, the next principle I want to talk about is SR and the law of attraction. Having some amount of sexual discipline in your life has a crazy effect. The words we say matter and the things we actually put out. It has an immediate impact on just our performance.
- When operating from a potent space, sometimes you're called to do things that scare you. For me, I realized I wanted to revitalize my podcast. I had to listen to what my superconscious hunches were telling me to travel more. While I have only just started that journey, I can tell it's already having great payoff.
- Pay attention to what's working. Pay attention to the things that are giving you way, because that's the universe telling you, hey, this is a good direction to go down. We start seeing these synchronicities more and more when we're on the right path.
