- Nearly 200 people RSVP'd for this one, so it looks like we're going to get a good crowd today. Let's get some music going. I think it's great they're experimenting with new features quickly. It feels like a startup again.
- As soon as someone starts talking, you can no longer play music. Another good feature request would be a bot that plays Academy Award music. Every time I'm on the mic, I just totally accidentally don't shut up enough.
- Jordan is a new Bankers Dow member. Meme Brains is the City Dow Podcast creator. To everyone listening, please share this space. Follow all the speakers on Twitter.
- Elson is the newest Orange Dow partner, a group of about 1300 Y Combinator alumni that formed a Dow that invests in startups. The panel discussed the concept of decentralizing, a jury system for Dow dispute resolutions and the how to Dow Project. If you can just intro yourself as you come up, that'd be great.
- The revision to the bankless Dow Constitution passed with over 18 mil bank tokens, giving a whopping 99.31% support ratio. To me, Dows are the natural evolution of human organization. I see a future where the entire world and beyond runs on decentralized networks.
- This is a Twitter space about DAOs, specifically about pain points and paths forward. What do you think are the biggest pain points in the Dow ecosystem right now? And most importantly, what do you see as the path forward to get us through it?
- So we'll kick things off with our featured speakers and then everyone listening. I'd like you to just raise your hand with your thoughts and your questions. When it's your turn to speak, just introduce yourself in less than 15 seconds. Please be patient if I don't get to you right away.
- It's okay to get off topic a bit, but let's keep things related to Dows. There's going to be a constant rotation of speakers. That means I'm going to boot some speakers off. So have fun.
- There are very few laws and regulations in the world specifically addressing DAOs. Dows need to do all the same stuff that traditional organizations do when it comes to legal issues. As soon as you can afford a lawyer, you should hire one.
- Jordan Punkar is with Emergent Labs accelerating the adoption of Web Three, the Internet computer and Sustainable Open Source. He says centralized infrastructure is one of the biggest pain points in the ICP ecosystem. Punkar says issuing proofs based on the information we already use to prove unique humanity is the path forward.
- Punkar from Bangkok Consulting speaks on how to Dow. Says the biggest pain point is we are overcomplicating stuff. Hopes the path forward will be like we will get into the space where we won't even call it a dow. Just an online entity.
- Damgen Elson is one of the newest Orange Dow partners. One of the main things that we have to think about is a business model to sustain the dow. A problem that we see is, like, retention. Manage that in order for our work to be at the same standard and continuous.
- Elson: What would you say are the biggest pain point maybe you've seen or you're working on in the Orange Dow ecosystem. And just Food for thought while we get ready to bring on Willy Wonka here. What's a reasonable time span to expect that we're actually going to be able to forge these paths forward to resolve the pain points?
- Willie: I'm now Head of Decentralization at the Fox Foundation which supports the Dao in achieving full decentralization. We're using Gitcoin passport right now for civil resistance and I'd say it's pretty good. Another path is to go the no entity route, which is what Shapeshift and Giveth are doing.
- Finding product market fit is especially tricky as a Dao. What I would like to see is separating the proposal process from transaction execution. Too much decentralization can accidentally lead to treasury drainings and too much centralization can lead know the exact opposite.
- Dowstrock is building a marketplace for DAOs. The main pain point with Dows are the people, right? Nearly 99.9% of people are not doing it full time. Legal across several continents is a big issue. Anyone that wants to join the discussions after the Twitter.
- We have mistaken voting for decision making and that's not how most decisions are made. It's a very much more fluid day to day decision making. The problem connects the problem of money. And we're trying to fix these voting systems.
- We've got the community call for CDAO coming up real soon. Thanks for hosting the space. I do have a lot of comments on what people are saying, but we'll try to follow up maybe in a thread with them.
- Oshin Lyons: There's a huge amount of collective intelligence within DAOs. He says tooling doesn't necessarily exist for Dao members to contribute on the different levels. Lyons: What I'm trying to highlight here is the two things intelligence and engagement.
- Dows and decentralization is amazing, but there are particular steps that need to be taken in order to make it work effectively. Going back to first principles is incredibly important into rethinking the things that we already have on hand. There's no pressure to stick around until it dies out.
- One of the things that we were speaking about recently within bankless Dow in the community call was code as law. And setting up a Dow with a code structure that automatically enacts proposals when they're voted upon. But before we go putting huge treasuries and lots of responsibility into code, all this stuff has to be tested.
- Vulcan: It's really cool to be getting more involved with Apecoin Dow. Things have been very confusing for newcomers and even people that have been around the Dow for a while. We've also started working on an onboarding guide to try to help this process for both new and existing members.
- Vulcan, Elson, Seb and Jordan lined up here. I'd like to shift as we wrap up on these next few speakers here and start moving and exploring more. What is working and what should we be doing more of and where is the seeds of the future solutions?
- Elson: If these business procedures were to be more decentralized or in somewhat incorporate voting, it wouldn't really make sense for our business particularly. For each business model you have to think how much decentralization do you really need?
- The core of a Dao is smart contracts. What I'm really excited about is seeing DAOs performing real actions. I'm doing a bootcamp on DAOs with Jordan. Once we have the technology, I think regulation and funding will build.
- Sebastian: What are the most successful DAOs out there? Jordan: I'm a part of Linksdao and Krause House. The Internet computer ecosystem is doing well. Seb: We have technology available to us that they never had. Could we implement a large scale liquid democracy system?
- There's the social DAOs and then there's more like the protocol Dao. I'm really curious what everyone thinks about this, that the dow structure might be working a bit more fluidly in a protocol based dow structure. Willy Wonka, welcome back to the stage.
- The community is focused on building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe. From First Principles, we believe it should be non custodial and also support multiple wallets. If we agree it's going to be community owned, then whichever interface has the strongest community will have a great chance at winning.
- Shapeshift Dao has a concept called work streams. A work stream is effectively a subdow with its own treasury and its own budget. The community ultimately decides which work streams are approved. It can be hard for the average token holder to participate in governance.
- The work stream topic is a really big one in my mind. What is one thing you could do after this Twitter space as a step towards resolving a pain point you're experiencing right now? Frontier, you're up. Can you guys just tell me when she's done speaking?
- Well, I wanted to thank Mean Brains for holding the space and being so gracious to have this conversation. Grace, I really respect your courage to speak truthfully. I have to admit I agree so much with what you've been saying.
- Just a couple of thoughts about organizational structure. It's like a Dao, from how I understand it, is that once you've deployed your Dao on chain, then how you articulate that is up to you and your community.
- Paige: When we grow up at Frontier Dow, I want to be like Big Green Dow. They're focused on urban gardening, small grants. To become a member of the Dow, you actually have to have already been selected and given a grant. I feel like by incorporating that into their blueprint, they keep their integrity.
- So anyway, it's late for me, too, so I don't want to ramble on too much. Thanks for your addition there, Frontier dow. I'm going to leave and come back. When I come back, if you could just make me co host again.
- Adam, I see you've got your hand up. Let's get you up on stage. Is there another Adam or are we good for me to go? You are the Adam.
- Adam Dao: There's like three core innovations that DAOs are bringing to the world. The first one is automating governance, just the top layer of governance. The second thing is that this technology does allow for much more democratic forms of organization. And the third is that because the blockchain controls money and software, for the first time ever, you can directly tie a governance process to money.
- Vulcan: Would you say that ape dow is kind of an evolution from the NFT? And is that going to be like a trend that we're seeing moving forward? What are some of the things that are really working right now that we should consider?
- If you want to do a Dao now, I would advise you to be anonymous, to be on chain. My prediction is that the next entity the SEC is going to sue is itself. Not everything has to be a Dow, right?
- Jordan: The next step here is I like the concept of doing a space maybe in two, three, four weeks on coming back to basic principles. Be more involved. Come out to the community calls. Just be more involved and plug ourselves in.
- Great job, Moon Brains. We are super appreciative having you here. Also, each shout out to all the guests that we had on tonight. Different time zones, different backgrounds, building loads of different things. Let's keep building.
- Joseph: Dows are the future of work. They're a new way for people to organize around a community. There are other opportunities to host Twitter spaces within Bankless Dao. If there's something that you want to share, just come to me or message the bankless dow.
