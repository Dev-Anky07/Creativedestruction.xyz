- John MC: A lot of this paper really comes from this idea that it's a transformational business idea. The common view that has probably been for the last 50 years in the legal literature of what a firm is, is really just a nexus of contracts. Our plan is to analyze the value implications and see which features of governance relate to positive returns.
- The big categories we have are DFI, basically what I'll call infrastructure, building out the ecosystem and then web three Dows. We've been working on expanding it to more and then we roughly did about 10,000 plus governance proposals. And it is a little mind blowing what they are doing.
- In the traditional equity context, what proposals we see are only governance, really. And actually, what I thought was even cooler is that reading some of these proposals, it was really about the viability of the protocol in the long term.
- Governor Bravo is probably one of the most common paradigms. What are the key provisions that I want to think about when going through the proposals and the process of voting? Things have totally different quorums and approval thresholds. People are experimenting in ways that I didn't expect.
- We're looking at crypto adjusted returns on proposal votes. What we're really seeing is the significance of restrictive governance features deterring from returns. Six out of the eight coefficients are negative and statistically significant.
- The more secure governance features you have, the more positive your returns are. Having inclusive but secure features are sort of the new novel ones. What we ultimately then do is actually put them all into the one index.
- We're seeing more value here in the voting rights. But that doesn't surprise me in some sense because we're voting on more important issues. The price of a vote is typically not large in the equity context. It may be largest when there's a change of control context.
- Virginia DAOs are an innovative organization meant to reduce the cost of centralized management by coordinating activities through decentralized governance. How they all mix is what determines the effectiveness of your organization.
- Culture is a force to align people on similar values. Sometimes culture isn't well defined. There's disagreement about what the culture should be. These are some of the things that I thought about a lot on how you can improve culture within firms.
- Culture is manifest in many elements but it brings unity to the employees perspective. 84% of the execs we had said culture is not where it should be and they thought that improving their culture would increase value. The need for continuous investment matters a lot.
- Nudges help people get better, work smarter, achieve more. They go through your work patterns and learn about you. Big thoughts and big ideas really need to be first thing in the morning for you. And so what they really have been doing is embracing these nudges.
- I think decentralizing everything can really backfire. Set your cultural values to match your customers values. Where there's a gap between the crowd and the developer team as being largest, that's where you want to go. We want it to be a smaller gap between users and developers.
- The distinction early on between the inclusive, restrictive and secure Dows and organizations. Have you been able to identify any cultural trends that tend to arise from any of these specific types?
- A simple thing of just using emoticons actually somehow just makes people more relatable. There has to be a way to get the empathy. It's actually a little bit sad that we're getting slower trust here. We are collecting data with one of the projects that we have collecting a lot of data from discord conversations.
- I wonder if DAOs may be different because of how decentralized they are that you're going to get more bottom up culture. We are trying to build quite a significant database and then hopefully partner as well with academics who want to use the database once anonymized.
- When I think the incentives are most misaligned, that actually might be the exact spot to work on. And I think forgetting sometimes the needs of who might be your community members. What kind of gaps are you thinking of?
- Dows is much more likely to be a, quote, investor than a service fee. I'm curious about how other models that you are seeing of using the crowdsourcing as an alternative mechanism for that. Could be inevitable sooner rather than later.
- The idea of citizen assemblies who on one side can perhaps be very inclusive or include very much the community to participate at the core of governance. And I have mixed feelings on outsourcing because in equity markets, most people outsource their votes. Now is the moment.
- Daniel: If you do get this data, I would love to know more about it. Like we're actually going to be rolling this out across as many communities as possible precisely to facilitate this sort of research on community health and better practices. A collaboration there would be super exciting.
