[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:29.000 ] Speaker A : Like New York City, nobody remembers anything, like, because it's all the young people. There's always young, trendy people whose parents pay for an apartment in New York City. And they show up and they're just like, said, I'm a New Yorker. And they came in. A lot of the kids that are there now came in during the sort of golden, sort of Bloomberg era when it was Giuliani had just, you know, stuck plungers up many black anuses to clean the place up. And we all kind of watch like, oh, don't do that.
[ 0:00:30.000 ---> 0:00:31.000 ] Speaker B : Which sort of turned away.
[ 0:00:32.000 ---> 0:00:34.000 ] Speaker C : People forgot about, cleaned up the story. What's that?
[ 0:00:34.000 ---> 0:00:35.000 ] Speaker D : People forgot about that.
[ 0:00:35.000 ---> 0:00:39.000 ] Speaker A : Amadou Diallo was the name of the guy, right? Yeah, no, Abner Luima.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:00:39.000 ] Speaker C : It's two guys.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:00:43.000 ] Speaker A : Abner Luima, I think, was the Plunger. It's Giuliani time.
[ 0:00:43.000 ---> 0:00:45.000 ] Speaker C : They stuck a plunger handle up his.
[ 0:00:45.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker A : Ass and say, amadou Diallo is a guy who was shot something like 68.
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:00:51.000 ] Speaker B : Times because he had a sandwich in his hand.
[ 0:00:51.000 ---> 0:00:52.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, Jesus.
[ 0:00:52.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker B : Kind of looked like a gun, even though it was vealed Parmesan.
[ 0:00:56.000 ---> 0:01:03.000 ] Speaker E : People forgot about Giuliani at one point in time. People thought he should be president after the way he handled 911.
[ 0:01:03.000 ---> 0:01:03.000 ] Speaker C : That's right.
[ 0:01:03.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker E : He was like, he's our leader. Yeah.
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker A : And just because he walked down the street with a coffee and said, oh, boy, it's rough. That's basically what he did. He didn't stop 911, he didn't solve 911. He didn't save anybody. There was no one to save. That's the most fucked up thing about that day, is that they had, the hospitals were all ready and there was like, nobody was injured.
[ 0:01:26.000 ---> 0:01:29.000 ] Speaker E : Were you living in New York City when that happened?
[ 0:01:29.000 ---> 0:01:36.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I was. I was not in the city the day before. On the 10th, I flew to LA to pitch a fucking TV show.
[ 0:01:36.000 ---> 0:01:36.000 ] Speaker D : Wow.
[ 0:01:36.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker A : And my wife was pregnant and we were living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which was right. I mean, come out of our house, the towers were our view right out the door. And so she was there, six months pregnant, and whammo.
[ 0:01:49.000 ---> 0:01:56.000 ] Speaker B : And she called me. It was like nine in the morning in LA or earlier, I guess it was like six.
[ 0:01:57.000 ---> 0:01:59.000 ] Speaker A : And she called me and she was.
[ 0:01:59.000 ---> 0:02:06.000 ] Speaker B : Just bawling and I was like, what's wrong? And she coUldn't say anything. And I was like, what the fuck is? And partly I'm like, am I in trouble?
[ 0:02:08.000 ---> 0:02:12.000 ] Speaker A : And then she says, turn on the TV. And I saw these towers on fire.
[ 0:02:12.000 ---> 0:02:17.000 ] Speaker B : And I was like, okay, it's nothing.
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:02:19.000 ] Speaker C : To do with home.
[ 0:02:19.000 ---> 0:02:58.000 ] Speaker A : This is a world problem, not a me problem. I'm pretty sure that's not my fault. No. Anyway, she handled it really well. Tod Barry, you know who? Todd. Right? He called her. She's the one who told him what had happened. He woke up not understanding what was happening and he was really scared and called my ex wife and she calmed him down. She's a good person. But anyway. Yes, and then. And I was like, get out of this. I just panic living in Manhattan because I grew up with movies like warriors and with memories like the blackouts. And I wasn't even there for the.
[ 0:02:58.000 ---> 0:03:01.000 ] Speaker C : Blackouts, but there was all these blackouts where everybody got killed.
[ 0:03:01.000 ---> 0:03:03.000 ] Speaker A : And there was a lot of movies about like, New York City is shut.
[ 0:03:04.000 ---> 0:03:06.000 ] Speaker B : Down, know the wolves come out.
[ 0:03:06.000 ---> 0:03:07.000 ] Speaker E : Yeah.
[ 0:03:07.000 ---> 0:03:09.000 ] Speaker C : So I thought as soon as it.
[ 0:03:09.000 ---> 0:03:15.000 ] Speaker A : Happened, I told her, get out of Manhattan. There's just going to be people throwing TV sets through windows in like 5 minutes.
[ 0:03:15.000 ---> 0:03:16.000 ] Speaker E : I just believe I am legend.
[ 0:03:16.000 ---> 0:03:19.000 ] Speaker C : Yes, that kind of thing. So get the fuck out of.
[ 0:03:19.000 ---> 0:03:36.000 ] Speaker A : So she got out of there and then I was on the road and I was in LA, I was supposed to pitch a show and I called the network and I said, I assume the meeting is canceled. And they said, yeah, but if you want your show to go forward.
[ 0:03:38.000 ---> 0:03:43.000 ] Speaker C : They made me pitch a comedy on September 11.
[ 0:03:43.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker A : On the Twelveth.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, the Twelveth.
[ 0:03:45.000 ---> 0:03:46.000 ] Speaker A : I had to go in day off.
[ 0:03:46.000 ---> 0:03:46.000 ] Speaker C : What's that?
[ 0:03:46.000 ---> 0:03:47.000 ] Speaker E : They gave you a day off?
[ 0:03:47.000 ---> 0:03:48.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that's right.
[ 0:03:48.000 ---> 0:03:49.000 ] Speaker D : It's a day to let everything settle.
[ 0:03:49.000 ---> 0:03:52.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, the Twelveth is my birthday, but.
[ 0:03:52.000 ---> 0:03:53.000 ] Speaker C : So I had to pitch a fucking comedy.
[ 0:03:53.000 ---> 0:03:55.000 ] Speaker A : And it was horrible.
[ 0:03:55.000 ---> 0:03:58.000 ] Speaker B : I mean, obviously that was terrible.
[ 0:03:58.000 ---> 0:04:05.000 ] Speaker A : And then I went back on the road, I was doing gigs. So I was flying as soon as they were flying, there was no airplanes.
[ 0:04:05.000 ---> 0:04:06.000 ] Speaker E : For how many days was it?
[ 0:04:06.000 ---> 0:04:27.000 ] Speaker A : I don't remember how long they didn't fly for, but I think it was a couple of weeks before a flight went up. I don't remember. But I started flying Right away. And the airports were all empty and everyone was allowed in the lounges and everyone was getting upgraded to first class because the planes were empty.
[ 0:04:27.000 ---> 0:04:33.000 ] Speaker C : And for a while it was part of the protocol before the flight takes off. They used to say they would give.
[ 0:04:33.000 ---> 0:04:38.000 ] Speaker A : You the safety stuff and then they would say you can use your seatbelt detaches, you can use it as a weapon.
[ 0:04:38.000 ---> 0:04:39.000 ] Speaker E : Oh Jesus.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:04:42.000 ] Speaker C : You can use your seat as a shield.
[ 0:04:42.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker A : And they would telling you that? Yes. They would say this is part of the thing for the first month after 911. And they would say, we're here to.
[ 0:04:49.000 ---> 0:04:51.000 ] Speaker C : Protect you, but you have to protect us.
[ 0:04:51.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker A : They would say that. And there was one flight I took where I was flying first class, like, seat one B. I was right at the bulkhead, and this other guy sitting at one C across from me, and the captain came out right before the flight, and he kind of squatted between.
[ 0:05:05.000 ---> 0:05:07.000 ] Speaker B : Us, and he said, listen, fellas, because.
[ 0:05:07.000 ---> 0:05:14.000 ] Speaker A : It was a red eye, he said, you're the last line of defense. So I need you not to sleep on this flight.
[ 0:05:14.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker D : Jesus Christ.
[ 0:05:16.000 ---> 0:05:19.000 ] Speaker E : I need you not to sleep until his light to defend him.
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:22.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, but of course, there's part of.
[ 0:05:22.000 ---> 0:05:23.000 ] Speaker A : Me that's like, I'm a guy, so.
[ 0:05:23.000 ---> 0:05:25.000 ] Speaker E : I'm like, oh, yes, sir.
[ 0:05:25.000 ---> 0:05:26.000 ] Speaker C : I was excited.
[ 0:05:26.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker E : Yeah. I got asked once by a lady. These two guys were fighting, and they were thinking about removing the guys from the plane because one guy had put his bag above this other guy's seat, and the other guy goes, hey, man, that's for my seat. And he's like, no, it's first come, first serve. He's like, no, fuck you. And then they were like, fuck you. No, fuck you. And then the lady had to come in and go, hey, I will fucking kick both of you guys off the plane.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:52.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, this is before you took off.
[ 0:05:52.000 ---> 0:06:00.000 ] Speaker E : Before we took off. She goes, do we have an understanding? And they go, yeah. And then she comes to me, she goes, hey, if anything goes down, you're going to help, right?
[ 0:06:00.000 ---> 0:06:02.000 ] Speaker C : She deputized you.
[ 0:06:02.000 ---> 0:06:07.000 ] Speaker E : She deputized me. I'm like, okay, what do you want me to do?
[ 0:06:11.000 ---> 0:06:13.000 ] Speaker A : What's my directive? What are my orders?
[ 0:06:13.000 ---> 0:06:19.000 ] Speaker E : If I go back there and smash some guy, am I in trouble? What am I allowed to do? Yes.
[ 0:06:19.000 ---> 0:06:22.000 ] Speaker A : You were directed by a company employee.
[ 0:06:22.000 ---> 0:06:24.000 ] Speaker C : And she has, like, federal power.
[ 0:06:24.000 ---> 0:06:42.000 ] Speaker E : I need you to put that on video. That's what I would have say it on my phone. Say, go ahead. Yeah, I need to know what's going on. First of all, I don't know who's right. I mean, this one guy who says it's his seat and it's above his seat, he's kind of got a point. And the other guy's got a point, too. Like, if that's the only space it's.
[ 0:06:42.000 ---> 0:06:48.000 ] Speaker A : Open, I don't think it's about who's right, right in that situation. It's not about who's right about that.
[ 0:06:48.000 ---> 0:06:48.000 ] Speaker E : Right.
[ 0:06:48.000 ---> 0:06:50.000 ] Speaker A : It's about if somebody throws hands.
[ 0:06:50.000 ---> 0:07:07.000 ] Speaker E : Well, it was about. One guy was really douchey about it. He could have been like, there was nothing else available. Is there a space over here? I'll move your bag for you. He could have made so many things. Yeah, they could have made some sort of a considerate.
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker A : He's probably got some at home.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker D : Probably.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:13.000 ] Speaker A : You get on a plane after a fight with whoever at home.
[ 0:07:13.000 ---> 0:07:14.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, yeah.
[ 0:07:15.000 ---> 0:07:24.000 ] Speaker A : Work sucks at home. He can't say it. He's got somebody who he's fighting with, who he needs to suppress. And so the first motherfucker.
[ 0:07:26.000 ---> 0:07:27.000 ] Speaker E : Or he's just a dick.
[ 0:07:27.000 ---> 0:07:29.000 ] Speaker A : He's just an asshole.
[ 0:07:29.000 ---> 0:07:29.000 ] Speaker D : Could be just a dick.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:37.000 ] Speaker A : I can't get my head around that. I always think it's something that's bothering him. I can't get my head around somebody.
[ 0:07:37.000 ---> 0:07:40.000 ] Speaker C : Who'S just like, well, some people think.
[ 0:07:40.000 ---> 0:07:44.000 ] Speaker D : You have to be that way to get ahead. You have to be a dick to get ahead.
[ 0:07:44.000 ---> 0:07:46.000 ] Speaker E : There's people that have that mentality, right?
[ 0:07:46.000 ---> 0:07:57.000 ] Speaker A : And there's people that feel comfortable if they can do that. Yeah, they're just comfortable if they can have whatever they want. So if you challenge it, they client, they have their logic. Usually it's just, fuck you. Yeah.
