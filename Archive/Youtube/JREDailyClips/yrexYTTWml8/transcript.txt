[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:14.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. One time, this guy I knew was having sex with this girl, and the rest of us were just kind of being lonely outside of his room. And we went on the balcony.
[ 0:00:14.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker B : We went on the picture. How many guys are outside of the room being lonely?
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:20.000 ] Speaker A : Three guys.
[ 0:00:21.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker B : So one guy's in there getting his freak on. Everybody else is outside.
[ 0:00:26.000 ---> 0:00:58.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. And because of the sounds, you feel so much fucking. And we went outside on the balcony. One guy was out there smoking a cigarette. And so then he starts listening to the sex through the window. Then he comes back in. He's like, you guys got to come in here. Chucky's doing some work in here. You know what? You know, it's worth coming out. It's almost like if you hear a good song, like, hey, guys. So we went out, and the guy leaned too close on the window and fell right through the fucking pane glass. Dude cut himself up, and then all of a sudden it's all exposed and they're in there.
[ 0:00:58.000 ---> 0:01:00.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my God.
[ 0:01:00.000 ---> 0:01:02.000 ] Speaker A : It was freaking. I felt bad for everybody.
[ 0:01:02.000 ---> 0:01:04.000 ] Speaker B : How was he leaning like that where he broke the window?
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:13.000 ] Speaker A : It was cheap windows. It was a college apartment complex. Like, probably single pane glass. Everything in there was cheap because people just broke it all the time.
[ 0:01:14.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker B : You imagine being a landlord for a bunch of college kids? Never imagine being a landlord today because so many people. There was rent protection during the pandemic, and people are still like, nah, not paying. Yeah, I know a guy who has not collected rent from this one person for three fucking years, and he's like, I can't get rid of them. I don't know what to do. I'm not making any. Like, I have to pay the mortgage, and I'm not making any money off of rent, and I can't rent it out to anybody else. And I can't get rid of them. And the lady has a job. The lady has a job. She goes to work every day and won't pay.
[ 0:01:48.000 ---> 0:01:49.000 ] Speaker A : That's. She shouldn't do that.
[ 0:01:50.000 ---> 0:01:54.000 ] Speaker B : No, but there's, like, in Los Angeles, there's rent protection.
[ 0:01:54.000 ---> 0:01:54.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, yeah.
[ 0:01:54.000 ---> 0:01:57.000 ] Speaker B : I don't know if that's still in place. Is that still in place?
[ 0:01:57.000 ---> 0:02:21.000 ] Speaker A : Do you know there's a TV show about bad people that do renting? THere's also. Oh, I had a tenant that stayed in an apartment that I had in New Orleans for two months and just didn't pay any rent. Thankfully, it was only two months, but it was just nothing. You could know by the time you have to go, did you own an apartment building? Yeah, not a building one apartment.
[ 0:02:21.000 ---> 0:02:21.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, really?
[ 0:02:21.000 ---> 0:02:22.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:02:22.000 ---> 0:02:24.000 ] Speaker B : And you rented it out and they wouldn't pay rent?
[ 0:02:24.000 ---> 0:02:25.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:02:25.000 ---> 0:02:40.000 ] Speaker B : Most people, they have shame. And if you fuck with them and keep, they want to either get out of there or they just want to pay you and get it over with. But some people are shameless, and this lady that this guy I know is renting out to is totally shameless.
[ 0:02:42.000 ---> 0:02:51.000 ] Speaker A : Do you think she was doing some type of secret work and she didn't want. What do you think the reason was?
[ 0:02:51.000 ---> 0:03:17.000 ] Speaker B : I think she would like to spend her money on other things. Yeah, I think it's that simple. I mean, who knows what kind of financial situation she's in? But she does have a job, and she goes to this job, apparently, according to him, and she just won't pay rent. Like when they put the rent protection thing on. I don't know. Exactly. I mean, I think the rent protection was supposed to be put in place for people that lost their job during the pandemic so that you wouldn't have a bunch of people just kicked out on the street.
[ 0:03:17.000 ---> 0:03:18.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Like a moratorium.
[ 0:03:18.000 ---> 0:03:27.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. I mean, a lot of people were calling for that, and it made sense during the pandemic. The problem with that stuff is, like, getting people to start back up again and pay.
[ 0:03:27.000 ---> 0:03:28.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it's hard.
[ 0:03:28.000 ---> 0:03:29.000 ] Speaker B : People don't want to do that.
[ 0:03:29.000 ---> 0:03:37.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Once you realize you can be somewhere without it, you just have to have a tough conversation at the door once a month or twice a month. And I think some people are going to do that.
[ 0:03:37.000 ---> 0:03:58.000 ] Speaker B : Well, that's the problem that a lot of people have with a lot of free money from the state, that once you get it, you don't want to not get it anymore. This was the argument against, like, universal basic income, is that once you start getting that money, then you're like, why am I working? Fuck working. I'll just live off of that mOney. That's it. I'll make a little bit on the side here and there and never work again. Yay.
[ 0:03:58.000 ---> 0:04:04.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I remember we talked about that one time. We were talking about universal basic income. I wonder if I would like it or not.
[ 0:04:04.000 ---> 0:04:07.000 ] Speaker B : Well, it'd be nice to have money where you don't have to think about food.
[ 0:04:07.000 ---> 0:04:07.000 ] Speaker A : Right.
[ 0:04:07.000 ---> 0:04:26.000 ] Speaker B : And don't have to think about rent. That would be great if everybody just had their rent and their food taken care of. The problem with that is, man, people need incentives. It's very difficult to just motivate yourself if you've got your food and your rent taken care of and you tend towards laziness you don't have a history of discipline.
[ 0:04:26.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker A : Especially now they got all those weighted blankets, too. Do you see that? Can you believe that shit?
[ 0:04:33.000 ---> 0:04:39.000 ] Speaker B : I could sleep on a fucking floor of a bus station. I don't need a weighted blanket. I'm always tired, dude.
[ 0:04:39.000 ---> 0:04:57.000 ] Speaker A : One time I was on this bus, man. I used to go work at this farm in the summer, and so I would take the bus up there to Greyham, and they had this dude on there. He's sitting on there next to me, and he's like, hey, you want to see something? And I thought it was going to be his dick because it's a freaking greyhound.
[ 0:04:57.000 ---> 0:05:05.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, you want to see something? It's either a human head or a dick. He pulls a head out of a bag.
[ 0:05:05.000 ---> 0:05:19.000 ] Speaker A : Either way, you're getting ahead, bro. But I said no the first couple of times. But the trip got longer, and I was like, all right, fuck it. Yeah, I'll see it. He opened up. He had a bag of jewelry and a gun. He had robbed a jewelry store before he got on the bus.
[ 0:05:19.000 ---> 0:05:21.000 ] Speaker B : Christ. And he wanted you to see it.
[ 0:05:21.000 ---> 0:05:35.000 ] Speaker A : He just wanted. Yeah, I think he wanted to kind of take some of the pressure off of him by sharing it with somebody else suddenly. Yeah, I think he's like, I got an accomplice or something. And then he even said, like, oh, we should get off at this next stop. And I'm like, I'm not in this shit.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:40.000 ] Speaker B : He's going to throw the bag at you and call the cops. I found him.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:45.000 ] Speaker A : He might have had a good idea. Maybe so.
[ 0:05:45.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker B : Well, that's a lot of people that commit crimes like that, they'Re kind of not that wired. Know, they're kind of screwball.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:53.000 ] Speaker A : Would you ever want to do a good crime?
[ 0:05:53.000 ---> 0:06:05.000 ] Speaker B : I would want to do a good crime. Bank robbery. Like a Lee Murray type bank robbery where you wear bulletproof armor and you come in, storm blazing like you're in a guy Ritchie movie.
[ 0:06:05.000 ---> 0:06:08.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. Get on the ground.
[ 0:06:08.000 ---> 0:06:13.000 ] Speaker B : Everybody down. Don't shoot some rounds into the ceiling.
[ 0:06:14.000 ---> 0:06:15.000 ] Speaker A : Shoot a chandelier.
[ 0:06:15.000 ---> 0:06:19.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, it comes crashing down. Everybody screams.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker A : If everybody listens, no one gets hurt. Yeah. Some ladies and then some guy, some, like, 65 year old guy, his cell phone rings, and it's that bad to the bone ringtone. You just fucking shoot that phone.
[ 0:06:35.000 ---> 0:06:58.000 ] Speaker B : Bad to the bone. You see some guy reaching under his waistband. Don't be a fucking hero. It's not your money. I saw this video the other day where this guy is sitting getting his haircut, and he's getting his haircut and this guy comes in and just shoots the dude cutting his hair. Boom. And he scrambles back, and the guy with the gun says, get out.
[ 0:06:58.000 ---> 0:06:59.000 ] Speaker A : Everybody get out.
[ 0:06:59.000 ---> 0:07:06.000 ] Speaker B : And the guy who was getting his haircut just reaches into his band, pulls out his gun. Don't, don't, don't. Just empties his clip into this dude.
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:08.000 ] Speaker A : It was real. Yeah.
[ 0:07:08.000 ---> 0:07:22.000 ] Speaker B : There's so many videos now. I follow a lot of shootings. It's, like, a lot of police posts. They get these security cam footage. Yeah, like, shootouts and stuff like that.
[ 0:07:22.000 ---> 0:07:26.000 ] Speaker A : A lot of them are in Mexico, too. It's crazy over there.
[ 0:07:26.000 ---> 0:07:27.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, it's crazy.
[ 0:07:27.000 ---> 0:07:34.000 ] Speaker A : People shooting each other point blank and can't even hit each other. Be there. That's the craziest ones, is when people are, like, right know.
[ 0:07:34.000 ---> 0:07:48.000 ] Speaker B : Go follow Ed Manifesto on Instagram. He's a dude that's been on the podcast a couple of times. His name is Ed Calderon, and he used to work for the Mexican government. He used to be in, like, the. You know, whatever. That is over. Yeah.
