[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:03.000 ] Speaker A : You ever do like a jumping jack, like a basic thing?
[ 0:00:04.000 ---> 0:00:04.000 ] Speaker B : Do I?
[ 0:00:04.000 ---> 0:00:05.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:00:09.000 ] Speaker B : No, I do not do that. But it's a good move. Jumping jacks are really good.
[ 0:00:09.000 ---> 0:00:10.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, trampoline.
[ 0:00:10.000 ---> 0:00:10.000 ] Speaker D : Very good.
[ 0:00:10.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker B : Side to side shit. I used to do a lot of those, a lot of side to side things till my last knee issue.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker E : Jumping jacks is when I knew we were to lose the war in Iraq. You ever see those videos of those guys teaching the Iraqi military? They're like, all right, we're going to do physical fitness.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:26.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, like the terrorists?
[ 0:00:26.000 ---> 0:00:34.000 ] Speaker E : Not the terrorists. Like Iraqi police and like the guys that were on our side. So we had our guys training them and they would try to do jumping jacks and it was like, yeah, let's watch.
[ 0:00:34.000 ---> 0:00:36.000 ] Speaker C : Really? I didn't know that.
[ 0:00:36.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker D : Jumping jacks.
[ 0:00:37.000 ---> 0:00:38.000 ] Speaker C : ISIS does the bars.
[ 0:00:38.000 ---> 0:00:39.000 ] Speaker E : Monkey bars.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker D : Monkey bars.
[ 0:00:40.000 ---> 0:00:41.000 ] Speaker C : Hilarious.
[ 0:00:41.000 ---> 0:00:42.000 ] Speaker A : Sleepweight camp.
[ 0:00:42.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker B : You guys ever see those videos of, like, kids in the 1960s in high school loving physical fitness?
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:49.000 ] Speaker E : It's jacked. Everybody's fucking.
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:00:53.000 ] Speaker B : Everybody's, like, ripped and they're all doing chin ups and they're all doing monkey bars. They're, like, swinging.
[ 0:00:53.000 ---> 0:00:55.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, they're ripped. They have twelve packs.
[ 0:00:55.000 ---> 0:00:56.000 ] Speaker B : What happened?
[ 0:00:57.000 ---> 0:00:57.000 ] Speaker D : What the fuck?
[ 0:00:57.000 ---> 0:00:59.000 ] Speaker E : Video games. Chilling.
[ 0:00:59.000 ---> 0:01:04.000 ] Speaker C : I think it's plastic. Well, there's a lot of preservatives in the guys. This is Ninja War.
[ 0:01:08.000 ---> 0:01:14.000 ] Speaker B : What fucking secret knowledge. Secret knowledge of jumping Jacks has been.
[ 0:01:14.000 ---> 0:01:17.000 ] Speaker A : This other guy can't separate his legs at all.
[ 0:01:17.000 ---> 0:01:19.000 ] Speaker B : This guy's hilarious.
[ 0:01:19.000 ---> 0:01:20.000 ] Speaker A : Every jump.
[ 0:01:20.000 ---> 0:01:23.000 ] Speaker C : It's like when the black comic brings the white guy on the dance.
[ 0:01:25.000 ---> 0:01:26.000 ] Speaker D : These guys are amazing.
[ 0:01:26.000 ---> 0:01:28.000 ] Speaker A : He's doing the Kremlin dance.
[ 0:01:29.000 ---> 0:01:31.000 ] Speaker C : What is he doing? We're going to win.
[ 0:01:31.000 ---> 0:01:33.000 ] Speaker E : Looks like they're doing the YMCA.
[ 0:01:33.000 ---> 0:01:34.000 ] Speaker A : It does look like that.
[ 0:01:34.000 ---> 0:01:36.000 ] Speaker B : It's fun to stay at the.
[ 0:01:38.000 ---> 0:01:38.000 ] Speaker E : Everyone sucks.
[ 0:01:38.000 ---> 0:01:41.000 ] Speaker B : One guy quit, he was like, I'm done. Yeah, it was stupid.
[ 0:01:41.000 ---> 0:01:44.000 ] Speaker A : I'm all about, but these jumping jacks are too much.
[ 0:01:44.000 ---> 0:01:45.000 ] Speaker C : It's too stupid.
[ 0:01:45.000 ---> 0:01:47.000 ] Speaker B : Why am I doing this? When is this going to come up.
[ 0:01:47.000 ---> 0:01:48.000 ] Speaker E : In real life combat?
[ 0:01:49.000 ---> 0:01:50.000 ] Speaker B : When is this going to come up?
[ 0:01:50.000 ---> 0:01:51.000 ] Speaker C : My body feels better.
[ 0:01:53.000 ---> 0:01:56.000 ] Speaker B : A touch of the poise. Here's the kids.
[ 0:01:56.000 ---> 0:01:57.000 ] Speaker E : Freaks, dude.
[ 0:01:59.000 ---> 0:02:01.000 ] Speaker B : Young boys in 1962, well, they were.
[ 0:02:02.000 ---> 0:02:02.000 ] Speaker C : Scared of the race war.
[ 0:02:02.000 ---> 0:02:04.000 ] Speaker B : This is all before plastic hit.
[ 0:02:04.000 ---> 0:02:05.000 ] Speaker E : WHat the fuck is this?
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:06.000 ] Speaker C : Preservatives.
[ 0:02:06.000 ---> 0:02:07.000 ] Speaker B : It's plastics.
[ 0:02:07.000 ---> 0:02:08.000 ] Speaker C : Body shaming.
[ 0:02:08.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : Plastics?
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:12.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, microplastics, body fat.
[ 0:02:12.000 ---> 0:02:14.000 ] Speaker B : They're endocrine disruptors.
[ 0:02:14.000 ---> 0:02:15.000 ] Speaker D : Look at that, kids.
[ 0:02:16.000 ---> 0:02:19.000 ] Speaker C : Well, there was war in the air. You still had to fight in the war.
[ 0:02:19.000 ---> 0:02:28.000 ] Speaker B : There was war in the air. World War II had just ended. We were talking about going to Vietnam. This is Ninja Warrior shit. Look at these kids animals.
[ 0:02:28.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker C : This is sexy.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker B : Look at this.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:33.000 ] Speaker C : They're all shirtless, but I bet none of them wrote a good book.
[ 0:02:33.000 ---> 0:02:37.000 ] Speaker B : I bet none of them sang a song anybody wanted to listen to.
[ 0:02:37.000 ---> 0:02:38.000 ] Speaker D : That's fun.
[ 0:02:38.000 ---> 0:02:39.000 ] Speaker C : We're fully loaded.
[ 0:02:39.000 ---> 0:02:42.000 ] Speaker B : We're hyper aggressive Americans.
[ 0:02:42.000 ---> 0:02:43.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. I wonder.
[ 0:02:43.000 ---> 0:02:53.000 ] Speaker B : I think that the microplastic thing is real. If you look at. There's a woman who wrote this book called Countdown. Her name is Shanna Swan. She's a doctor from Harvard.
[ 0:02:53.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker E : Right.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:02:54.000 ] Speaker B : I always ask.
[ 0:02:54.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker E : Yeah, Taint lady.
[ 0:02:55.000 ---> 0:02:55.000 ] Speaker D : Right?
[ 0:02:55.000 ---> 0:02:57.000 ] Speaker B : Taint lady. Yeah, Taint lady.
[ 0:02:57.000 ---> 0:02:58.000 ] Speaker E : Talk to Taints on here.
[ 0:02:58.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker B : When you exposure to phthalates, like, it's a type of. It's a chemical that's in plastics and some other things. They disrupts her endocrine system and it fucks up with mammals. With the males, it makes their taint smaller, makes their dick smaller, makes their Ball smaller, sperm count, and they find them in human beings. These are like studies they've done in mammals. So they did studies. One of the best ways to determine male or Female in young mammals is the male's taint is 50% to 100% larger. So they look at that to see if it's a boy or a girl. And when you expose the animal to phthalates, that Shrinks and it sort of Feminizes the Boys. They have less testosterone. Their Penises shrink. Their taint Shrink.
[ 0:03:44.000 ---> 0:03:44.000 ] Speaker E : Son of a.
[ 0:03:45.000 ---> 0:04:05.000 ] Speaker B : And there's a similar effect in human beings. And she believes that that's the Driving force. And she thinks that we've been exposed since people have been using microwaves and everything's in plastic and water bottles in your car, all these different chemicals, and then there's Fertilizers and pesticides and herbicides. All that shit's getting into your body.
[ 0:04:06.000 ---> 0:04:15.000 ] Speaker E : Sucks to be the Guy that was dating her. He was like, what are you ResearChing? She's like, why is everybody's dick small these days? What are you talking about, honey?
[ 0:04:15.000 ---> 0:04:22.000 ] Speaker B : She's a hilarious older woman. She's really funny, man. She has a thing on her Instagram called the Jizz Quiz.
[ 0:04:22.000 ---> 0:04:23.000 ] Speaker D : Whoa.
[ 0:04:24.000 ---> 0:04:37.000 ] Speaker B : It's like, she's funny, but she's talking about real science. And it's kind of a disarming way to do it because she's such a sweet lady and she's so fun, but she's talking about what's going on with microplastics.
[ 0:04:37.000 ---> 0:04:40.000 ] Speaker C : If you jizz in her face without telling her, it's a pop quiz.
[ 0:04:44.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker B : God damn it.
[ 0:04:48.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker C : You never know what?
[ 0:04:49.000 ---> 0:04:49.000 ] Speaker D : It's.
[ 0:04:49.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker B : Imagine if that really is it. And imagine if when they introduced plastics to humans, it was just inevitably going to weaken us as a species. And there's no way we could have known because we'd never had plastic before, so there was no plastic forever. And then 19, whatever it is, 50s, when does it start? Where people start using plastics everywhere.
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:11.000 ] Speaker C : Milk used to come in a jar.
[ 0:05:11.000 ---> 0:05:33.000 ] Speaker B : At that same time. There's direct drop sperm cell count. And women are having more miscarriages. Yeah. Less fertility from both the male and the female. And the males. So it's not just like feminizing, it's messing up the females, too. And it's doing something to the males. It's like crushing its reproductive system.
[ 0:05:33.000 ---> 0:05:37.000 ] Speaker C : I think she said we'd eat a credit card of plastic a week.
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:05:47.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, that's what she said. But there's some dispute about that. It's an average thing. Are some people getting way more of it or are some people getting none of it? Is there a way to avoid it?
[ 0:05:47.000 ---> 0:05:58.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. You know, it's weird. When you check into a hotel and you see a family and they bring in like, a 20 case of bottled water and you're like, what are you doing? You're going to be here two nights. You need all that bottled water.
[ 0:05:59.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker B : You just buy a bottled water. Where the fuck did it come from? Was it on a boat in Thailand from drifting across the ocean? Where did your water come from? I don't even ask. I just drink it. So what if I'm drinking some bullshit fucking chemicals, it's going to make my tank shrank.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:06:19.000 ] Speaker C : I'm a tap man.
[ 0:06:19.000 ---> 0:06:24.000 ] Speaker B : I love tap. It's really not good for you. Yeah, tap water is not good for.
[ 0:06:24.000 ---> 0:06:26.000 ] Speaker E : Everybody in New York loves saying, New York has the best tap water.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:31.000 ] Speaker B : That's so ridiculous. It's like zero chance that saying, my shit smells the sweetest.
[ 0:06:31.000 ---> 0:06:32.000 ] Speaker C : Well, that's true.
[ 0:06:32.000 ---> 0:06:37.000 ] Speaker A : New York, it's like they said, the water is good, but the taps are all shitty. So you're drinking like the rust, bro.
[ 0:06:37.000 ---> 0:06:38.000 ] Speaker B : Who's cleaning?
[ 0:06:38.000 ---> 0:06:39.000 ] Speaker E : Nobody.
[ 0:06:39.000 ---> 0:06:47.000 ] Speaker B : Mean rats in those. Imagine if you could get like, a camera down a mile or so into those pipes and see the crud.
[ 0:06:47.000 ---> 0:06:52.000 ] Speaker A : I had a landlord tell me it was normal for it to come out brown in the beginning, and I was like, can I come to your house and see if it's like that there?
[ 0:06:53.000 ---> 0:06:58.000 ] Speaker B : What the fuck are you talking about? You're supposed to drink that. You're supposed to bathe in that.
[ 0:06:59.000 ---> 0:07:03.000 ] Speaker C : I do the shower with the mouth open. You ever do that one. Let it flow right in.
[ 0:07:03.000 ---> 0:07:05.000 ] Speaker E : When I was a kid, I used to chug shower.
[ 0:07:05.000 ---> 0:07:06.000 ] Speaker D : I do that today.
[ 0:07:06.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker B : There's some real disputes about fluoride in water, too.
[ 0:07:09.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker E : Yeah.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:26.000 ] Speaker B : To be honest, I'm not super well versed in. It's good for the teeth, apparently. Sort of. But what's really good for the teeth is brushing your fucking teeth. It's like, are we sure that you're supposed to be dumping fluoride in the water that people drink?
[ 0:07:26.000 ---> 0:07:28.000 ] Speaker C : It is a bit of an assumption.
[ 0:07:28.000 ---> 0:07:34.000 ] Speaker B : Do you know that fluoride lowers your IQ? No. Yeah, it does. Definitely. Exposure to fluoride lowers your IQ.
[ 0:07:35.000 ---> 0:07:35.000 ] Speaker C : Oh, come on.
