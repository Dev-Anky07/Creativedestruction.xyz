- Apecoms special counsel debrief number 47. Consider this the library session. A couple of technical difficulties. I'll invite a few of our wonderful apecoms team up here real quickly. If anybody wants to come on up and be on stage and have some conversations.
- GM: This week has just been a lot of work. Everybody's popping up during the election season. We love to see who's here now, who's going to be around for the next election. We want to set yourself up for success when you're running.
- Jerry: One of the things that you had in the breakdown was advocating for a more simple language in aips to guide revenue back to the Dow. What does that mean? Do you have any clarifications on that?
- Finalizing strategies to significantly reduce the custodial fees, contributing to financial efficiency. The SC was working on making sure that we're set up for the future. And it ended up being a pretty substantial amount that we were able to save everybody.
- If you have an idea for an aip, just put it up one sentence. More ideas are better and it gets everybody talking, gets everybody thinking. I'm also going to get a conversation going again on shielded voting front to back.
- SSP: Save anything you want to say before we wrap it up. It was great hearing from, I think, most of the special counsel. Let everybody have the opportunity to have the discussion again Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays and noon. See you guys on Friday.
