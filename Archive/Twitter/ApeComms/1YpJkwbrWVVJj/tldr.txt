- Thank you. I appreciate the fact that I had moved this space to be inclusive of our asian constituency and community. It's really ridiculous that I can't launch this from a browser instance. Mocha chief is co host and does assist, but often at the last minute. The teamwork makes a dream work.
- Raymond: My name is Raymond. I run a small architecture design firm. I want to bring more creators to the space. I'm working to muster up and build a metaverse working group, Wednesdays. This is to rally builders especially.
- GM: I have really enjoyed getting to know you and look forward to building. Do you speak any languages other than English, by the way? I'm Filipino. We are very invested in the filipino community. Going to start your timer, and you are on for your three minute introduction and pitch.
- Toby is running for marketing and communications, working group steward. Currently handles operations and special projects and the socials of boring security. Also active in the IRL web three scene and events here in Manila. His goal is to give apecoin the attention and spotlight that it deserves.
- Who wants to go up first? Amp, are you good or who's on stage? Amp is on stage. SSP is running for special counsel. Tell us a little bit about your campaign. Appreciate the time you guys put into this space every week.
- But very much wanted to thank everybody who's here in the audience, especially now at the end here. I do think that we all need to strive to work together more and build up ourselves. Whether I'm elected or not, it's time to get these things put together.
