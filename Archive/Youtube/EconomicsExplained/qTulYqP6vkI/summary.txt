- On 21 July 1969, neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men in history to step foot on the Moon. Since then, just ten more people followed in their footsteps over the span of less than four years. The reason humanity hasn't been back is not due to lack of capacity. The real reason is obviously economics.
- We can get much more affordable and amazing coffee from Trade. Trade sends you coffees from over 55 of the top roasters. You can make a better cup of coffee at home than most cafes do. Are there any ways to make permanent settlements in outer space economically viable?
- Getting access to more resources is the obvious reason to venture into space. But here on Earth we have a fundamentally limited supply of resources. Becoming a space faring civilization could give humanity access to unlimited resources. But that would fundamentally alter the nature of economics itself.

Without direct access to the world's oceans, these countries can't use container ships to directly export their goods. If an economy can't develop basic industries, it won't be able to raise taxes or build infrastructure.
- To get a kilogram worth of material from Earth to Mars at the moment costs around $2.1 million. As humanity has grown wealthier, it is also using more energy. An easy way out of this limitation would be to expand into space where energy can be harvested on a larger scale.
