- All of our authors coming in to join us for the AIP roundup this week. We've got election season coverage kicked off and going on throughout the community. We are going to focus on the AIPS today as we do on Mondays. Happy to invite the community to ask questions.
- SSP: Another week of exciting AIPS, another week of excitement in the Dow with elections. GM: I did have a Red Bull instead of a coffee today, but they had a seasonal flavor. If we're going to really clickbait troll some people in here, it's got to have elections in the title.
- We have plenty to talk about with regards to the proposal. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. If you guys do want to join us, there's a little bit of space left up here.
- Aaron: Happy to be here, happy to answer any and all questions, no matter how contentious they may be. Special council elections are on right now too, so it's extra spicy. Don't hold back now. The Forgotten Ruins community is ready.
- Aaron: I will respect whatever pronouns that you want me to call you. Aaron: I think the Bay Area is an event that is a city that we're thinking about maybe even for the first event. Let me know when your transition is done.
- Is it just as valuable to have new Holders in the audience that we bring into the Apecoin Dow as it is to have existing Holders come to the live events? All right, this is a discussion for another day.
- SSB Red Bull originated in Thailand. Austrian guy made it more palatable to Western sort of flavor profiles. In Austria, there's one restaurant in all of Earth that is owned by Red Bull. We got eight magic cards coming up for the eight magic card showdown.
- Uzi: I think you're the nicest, kindest host on spaces so far I've met. State of Web Three. I've never seen anything like that before. Glad to see all familiar faces today and looking forward to it.
- All right, we got TFG's requesting to come up. There's just the three, so it shouldn't take too long. Some very simple proposals here and we'll address the authors just after the summaries.
- AIP 349 is to create a custom Apecoin events page on Cryptoevents XYZ. AIP 364 seeks to integrate Ape coin into the Battle for Goblin Town board game. The elections are live and these AIPS are live, so plenty of things to vote on.
- AIP 372 enable AIP voting during elections. No AIPS may be submitted for voting during the election cycle. Would apply to both of the weeks of Special Counsel voting. Voting underway now.
- No, I mean, as you know, the IRL events, crypto events, I'm looking forward to that one. And then obviously, we're going to get deep most fully into the Forgotten Runes Goblin Town one. Let's talk about it so people can vote with some knowledge.
- This is our first Twitter spaces and speakers with Apecoin. So it's very exciting to hear how you guys conduct. It's really fun and interesting.
- The Crypto Nomads Club is a community of Web Three builders who meet at different crypto conferences and hackathons worldwide. The idea is to bridge the gap between the NFT community and the Web Three builder community. To date, we have almost 10,000 events recorded.
- Where do you find all of the events? Is there a place to find other events besides the main page? What you're asking for now is the funding to put Apecoin events up on the site. Would have liked to see something where the ask included giving utility to ApeCoin members.
- Would you consider giving Apecoin members the ability or the same perks as some of the members? I think it's definitely not out of the question. And I hope it passes. I would probably switch my vote to what is currently no to yes.
- The Apecoin Dow needs a central area HQ of this kind of information. How do you accept, let's say, events coming in from event organizers and then how do you vet them? Is it manual or is it automated?
- Is this going to be an app where I get notifications? How do I do that? Will I be responsible for getting notifications on your Twitter page? How am I going to get the information? The app is already live. We're just applying it towards Apecoin.
- Are you looking at adding more web two events? For example, there's a ton of events that are happening in Art Basel right now. Our goal is web three and do a really good job in web three. Now we want to kind of go more into NFTs.
- Aaron: I'm absolutely going to change my vote in favor of the proposal. As part of my AIP, I'm tasked with finding twelve cities to put in real life comedy events up for Web Three. And so I'd like to understand just how to use your site a little bit more.
- Apecoin provides a platform somewhere safe for you all to connect and learn. It's been great learning about AIP 349. And thank you, Jess, for coming up and spending so much time and energy.
- SSP: You're welcome up to join us anytime. We do these Monday, Wednesday and Friday at noon. If you ever wanted to come and update us on what you're working on, whether the proposal is approved or not. Let's move on.
- Forgotten Runes is a decentralized world building project. Imagine if Tolkien had open sourced Middle Earth. The entire community owns it financially and creatively. We have a ten issue comic in production. We're two years into working on an MMORPG. We've got a TV show in development.
- The game is basically inspired by the very popular board game called Settlers of Catan. It is a hex tile based game where each Hex tile represents resources. Online we're basically including all of Crypto, Twitter. We'll have thousands and thousands of players playing simultaneously 24 hours a day.
- The proposal that we have, well, I could sit here and listen all day. We're asking for one and a half million dollars for our company for making this project apecoin exclusive and $500,000 for the prize pool. As the game is more successful, the 15% of all of the revenue will actually be burned.
- Gordon goner said that we were his favorite non Yuga NFT project a few weeks ago. I think that's good. If he likes you, I think a lot of other people like you, too. But if you guys feel like leaking something, we can't see your eyes or your faces.
- 15% of apecoin generated during the mint would be burned, transferred to a debt address. 20% of ongoing game revenue to go towards supporting a future prize pool or another burn. How did you guys arrive at these as the different ways to return revenue to the dow?
- SSP: Do you have a general forecasted idea of what that 15% is in your mind for the first season? Aaron: Our plan is that this project will generate we would love for this game to generate three to $5 million on its mint. SSP: I tend to under promise and over deliver.
- Before we go to Aaron, I forgot we let profits up on the stage as well. She's got crazy events going on this week. Make sure you guys are tapping in. It looks like there's some apecoin activities going on at this event.
- Forgotten Runes is releasing a half degenerate gambling video game. Dada says the gaming narrative is pretty ripe right now. He says an important part of marketing is baking in the proper incentive systems.
- We need a smaller suit for profits. We need a suit that's made for the Miami Heat for profits as well. Maybe I'll wear a suit. Apecoin will be highly represented. I wish I could be out there.
- Gordon: $2 million is a big ask for a game that is sort of untested. If it doesn't go through, would you resubmit with a smaller ask? We are talking to a couple of other platforms that have reached out as they've seen the AIP and that are interested. Send your questions in the bottom.
- Aquamarine MFR founder questions the appetite for a game like this. He says the small reward of only $500,000 is not enough incentive for him to hire people to grind for him. He suggests something like Dookie Dash, a ten to 14 day tournament.
-  TFG: The split of 15% and us paying $1.5 million to be on this project with you seems very unfair. We should be 50 50 partners at the very least, in my opinion. What is the fair creation of value or benefit for the Dow relative to the ask?
- 15% of ape gets returned to the dow, but another 15% getting burned. What we actually do have here is a 50 50 split. 50% goes to dow burning and a future prize pool that's not going to magic machine. We could negotiate the individual splits.
- Would you guys ever be willing to look at any sort of clawback mechanism or put any of the 1.5 sort of at risk? After we finish the voting phase, there'll be effectively like a legal negotiation phase with the special counsel. I don't know how much of that risk we would be comfortable taking on.
- Billy Joe: I'm not sure it's the place for an AIP to provide voting incentives. Does that principle get what level that rises to? Billy Joe: There has to be a certain process with. And look, two people can look at the same thing and disagree.
- If you guys have one apecoin, you can submit a proposal. You can recommend ways for the process to change. Get that one ape coin to be a part of the system while it lasts. And then let's talk to Chris about allowing proposals to go up to vote during elections.
- If this game works, really, this will be the first true Apecoin sync. Excited to play with you all. Forgotten Ruins. I want that on a T shirt, actually.
- The gaming discussion is certainly one of the more exciting discussions we're going to have. How does a gaming company then bring value back in terms of not just rev share? Look forward to more conversations about this and future gaming initiatives.
- Are you expecting the 2 million over the three seasons or are you expecting it upfront? And if you are expecting it up front, would you be prepared to accept it in tranches over theThree seasons. I think we're happy to negotiate with the Special Counsel with whatever they feel comfortable with.
- We got bearsnake up here too. SSP gave them the thumbs up. Let me tell you, I don't think I trust anyone well, maybe my wife. I wouldn't be surprised if you spend more time with at least one of these guys than your wife.
- Chris: I think this is a positive case study if it goes through for what the Dow can sort of support. We'd love to hear about what you guys are working on in the future as well. Come back, give us updates, share with us what you're doing.
- Proposal 372. To enable AIP voting during elections. Chris: This proposal was not intended to target the Special Counsel in any way. SSP: Did you have something I think we want to get into?
- Why are we putting these AIPS on hold during the election season? There has been plenty of time for nominees to speak their mind. We do have a language tool plugin that will allow any post to be translated. I would love to hear what others are thinking.
- The criticism was that in the past authors weren't being recognized because election season was going on. providing authors with the ample opportunity to have those AIPS put up in a timely fashion when they're ready is important.
- Dim was against the proposal simply because he just wanted to make sure that he's not overwhelmed as a delegate and can actually give the right info to the office. My angle on it is that it should be optional. I don't think that we should try and force authors to or not to post an AIP during any specific time.
- Has your perspective changed at all on the AIP or are they exactly the same now as they were before? Do you have an inclining for a follow up step if this does get approved? And if the community sees fit to implement them, then great, so be it.
- Chris: I think I would prefer if we didn't have AIPS during election season. And the second point that I made was when it came to SC admin review and AIP. But does it make a material difference? Probably not.
- AIP 372 will send more options for the authors during the election season. Sometimes less visibility is better. Sometimes having too much visibility isn't always in your favor. So thank you again for sharing and also for spending so much time.
- Board Ape G has a proposal to only have proposals go up twice a month. How many proposals do we want to see up to vote? What is the minimum amount of proposals? We're expecting more and more proposals in 2024.
- Is the process itself need a broader holistic view as opposed to just chipping away at little pieces here and there. There's just so much administrative waste within the administration. We just have to have better quality proposals that deserve to go up to a Daoi vote.
- Board Ape G: The way that we've kind of structured our Dow is a little bit confusing. There's one AIP in process that would define a temperature check process for the community. This is the larger discussion that needs to be had with the community, he says.
- The Governance Working Group was elected to look, to govern, to put governance processes in there. How do we get folks who actually show up at Snapshot voting with their millions more involved? What might work here in Beverly Hills, Southern California, is not going to work in the majority of places in the world.
- Ape G: The most I'll say the most is ten. Other AIPS will, assuming it passed, will end up modifying it. It kind of takes something to light a fire under someone, to finally go do something.
- Ten is the max per week? Well, not max, but effectively we've kind of been seeing that. If it was going to be bimonthly, you probably wouldn't want more than ten. We want to go through a Dow. I vote.
- How do we decide urgency on which proposals are like, priority levels for which proposals should go to vote? If we're stretching out the voting cadence by an extra week, people would have more time to review the proposals.
- Extending the voting window gives opportunities first and foremost to the authors to go do their campaign. I think we still need it all for there should be less AIP. Who's the group that's going to help make us a better process for everybody?
- Ten KTF is known for rugs. It's only fair that he would rug us. So we need more people stepping up.
- Starting now, everybody start writing as many AIPS as they possibly can. Submitting more than one AIP is going to be in the past. Lots of stages to come. We got announcements on the way. Keep your eyes peeled.
- Don't forget to get your votes in. Get till Wednesday at 06:00 p. m. PST. I got another song stacked up. We're getting out of here.
