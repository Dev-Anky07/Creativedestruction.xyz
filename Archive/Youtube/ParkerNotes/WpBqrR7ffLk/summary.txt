- Park Notes' Parker Sette Case lays out how you can think and journal like a philosopher. He distinguishes between journaling from keeping a diary and a commonplace book. He lays out three key features for thinking like a philosophers.
- A diary is just a book that is used to record your daily experiences and events. A journal is a personal record of your thoughts and ideas. I also keep commonplace books and compendiums. This is something between a diary and a journal.
-  thinking like a philosopher is at once very easy and very, very difficult. The better you get at using these three features, the harder they get. As you get better at doing philosophy, philosophy becomes more difficult.
- Keeping a deep thinking philosophy journal is actually pretty easy. Go find a place that is conducive to deep thinking. Write that down, and then be clear. Give arguments for your position. Then address counterarguments and counterexamples.
