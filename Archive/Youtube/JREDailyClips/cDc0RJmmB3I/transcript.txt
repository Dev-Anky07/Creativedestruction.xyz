[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker A : Brody was kind of hard to do business with in the ring. He was really stiff and would beat the shit out of you. He wouldn't put anybody over. He was. He was a big, big man. Six foot, 8330 pounds, in crazy shape. And, you know, they wanted to beat him. He goes, nah, not tonight, brother.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker B : Wow.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:33.000 ] Speaker A : So after the match, they said, hey, Jose wants to talk to you in the shower. Brody went walking the shower. He jumped him, cut his throat. He died right there. And all the wrestlers that saw lot, we're afraid to go back and testify. So it can get crazy.
[ 0:00:34.000 ---> 0:00:43.000 ] Speaker C : That's about as crazy as it gets. So you guys were the first ones to break those boundaries and kind of barnstorm the whole country like that. Vance is a gangster, bro.
[ 0:00:43.000 ---> 0:01:03.000 ] Speaker A : That's such a country. How about going to Germany? Or, you know, because they had wrestling over there, too. How about blowing to, you know, getting challenged by the South African heavyweight champion, Wilhelm Ruska? That judo guy. My God, it goes on and on and on with how crazy it know.
[ 0:01:03.000 ---> 0:01:04.000 ] Speaker C : What was that like?
[ 0:01:04.000 ---> 0:01:31.000 ] Speaker A : It was different. The good thing was, everywhere I went, I had, like, the crew with me, except for when I went to South Africa, that was a little different. But everywhere I went, it was always the crew and the WWE, 20 or 30 wrestlers that were there. So you felt a lot better, right? I try not to peel off on my own too often, especially when we're walking someone else's backyard, that they've been promoting wrestling for 30, 40, 50 years, and all of a sudden, you come.
[ 0:01:31.000 ---> 0:01:32.000 ] Speaker C : Here, and they have the same sort.
[ 0:01:32.000 ---> 0:01:36.000 ] Speaker A : Of unspoken rules out there, and we broke them all.
[ 0:01:36.000 ---> 0:01:45.000 ] Speaker C : Wow. Yeah. I never even considered that as a possibility that there would be these territories.
[ 0:01:45.000 ---> 0:02:02.000 ] Speaker B : Well, that's one of the main things that made Vince Jr. So famous and changed the game forever. Vince Senior always wanted him. Wasn't it like a promise, a handshake deal? You can have the company, son, but just please don't ever mess with the other territories and Vince. Okay.
[ 0:02:05.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker A : If my dad knew what we were getting ready to do, he'd have never sold me the territory.
[ 0:02:09.000 ---> 0:02:09.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:02:10.000 ---> 0:02:14.000 ] Speaker A : Wow. I'm like, okay. He goes, you up for it? I said, yeah, let's do it.
[ 0:02:14.000 ---> 0:02:17.000 ] Speaker C : Was the dad alive when this was going down?
[ 0:02:17.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker A : For a while. For a while. I had pancreatic cancer, and he was alive. Like, when I went back. When I went back. Oh, God, it's such a crazy story. I hate to get into all this stuff, but it's all true. Like, when I went back, I had just been in Minnesota, spent three years Hulk Hogan had really, that Hulk mania thing had started there, and I was on fire there. I mean, really on fire. And so now when I go back to New York, Vince had flown to my house. We talked about doing a deal. So I said, on a certain day, I'm coming back to New York. I did two, three weeks of TV. Then when I was supposed to beat the Iron chic for the belt that night, Vince senior was there. He always had these half glasses that he'd look over, and he's always clicking quarters together when he talk to know. And I'm standing there with Vince Senior and Vince Jr. And myself, and Bob Baklam's standing there. Who was the champion that the Iron sheep beat for the belt. Now the Iron chic's got the belt. And Bachelor thought he was getting the belt back. And Bachlam was my guy. Used to go to Japan with him and train within Japan when nobody else would run steps with him and everything in the hotel. All of a sudden, I'm sitting there and Vince is clicking the quarters together, and he goes, well, I'm really know that. I really don't think we should do this. We should put this off for about six months. And Bob Bachelor pops up and goes, yeah, I think a real athlete should be the champion. I'm looking over at him, right? And like, what the hell's going on? Know? And then out of know, I said, well, guys, I just had a huge bridge. I just burnt down in Minnesota. I built a big bridge there. I'll tell you what, I'll rest the honor sheets and I'll put his ass over, because that's business. But I'm leaving. I'm going back and rebuild that bridge. Thank you guys very much for bringing me up there. I went back to the dressing room. It was about ten or 15 minutes later, Vince Jr. Came in and says, oh, everything's okay. I talked to my dad, everything settled down. I said, are you sure? Now what I don't know on the backside is, when I leave Minnesota, the promoter, Vern Ganyu, who worked there, the Iron Sheik, Cosgrove, Lazario, whatever his real name was, he was a real bodyguard for the Shah of Iran. He was the real deal, bro. He's got all these huge dents and holes in his head where they used to beat him and stuff when he was over there. Little did I know. Cause the iron chic broke in with Veranganya in Minnesota, right? So now I come to New York, and I'm going to win the belt. And Vern Ghana was pissed at me for leaving. So he calls cause up and said, I'll give you 100 grand to break Hogan's leg. Right? And now this guy's an NCAA champion. The real deal. I'm not. So Vern offers him 100 grand to break my leg. And we go in the ring, and, I mean, I'm giving you my arm and take my head and take my leg. I think we're working, not shooting. And he told us afterwards, my accent is terrible. The iron sheet goes, but Verna called me and want to give me 100 grand to break your leg. But I'm a businessman. I just hope we can keep working together. I said, brother, don't worry. We're going to work together all the time. Wow. But I don't know if you knew about that, if you're a wrestling fan.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:40.000 ] Speaker B : I didn't know that. He was offered 100,000 to break your leg. Smart move for him to not take it. You get 100,000 there and then you guys never work together. And he's never anywhere near what he became. One of the ultimate heels of all time.
[ 0:05:41.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, but these are all. Everybody knows these stories, man.
[ 0:05:43.000 ---> 0:05:45.000 ] Speaker C : Also, he's an athlete. He's not a hit man.
[ 0:05:45.000 ---> 0:05:46.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:05:46.000 ---> 0:05:48.000 ] Speaker C : It's kind of fucked up.
[ 0:05:48.000 ---> 0:05:53.000 ] Speaker A : It's a different business. You'd be surprised. Those rules don't apply all the time.
[ 0:05:53.000 ---> 0:05:56.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, I'm sure. It's just I love the Iron chic.
[ 0:05:56.000 ---> 0:05:57.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, he's great.
[ 0:05:57.000 ---> 0:06:07.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, I hung out with him one time in that Toronto pot. Know where they have that marijuana show where the entire room was filled with weed smoke?
[ 0:06:08.000 ---> 0:06:08.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:06:08.000 ---> 0:06:10.000 ] Speaker C : And the iron sheet got on stage with me.
[ 0:06:10.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, he's the man. I roasted him three times. LA, Toronto and Hamilton, Canada. I told him he's such a nice guy, he'd give you the shirt off his head.
[ 0:06:23.000 ---> 0:06:27.000 ] Speaker C : He was a freak athlete, too, man. You ever see him do the clubs? Yeah.
[ 0:06:27.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker A : None of us could do it. We all tried. None of us could do it. I couldn't do it. Andre couldn't do it. None of us could do it.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:34.000 ] Speaker C : Andre couldn't do it.
[ 0:06:34.000 ---> 0:06:37.000 ] Speaker A : None of us could do it. Bro, those clubs are like, 85 pounds apiece.
[ 0:06:37.000 ---> 0:06:38.000 ] Speaker C : Are they really?
[ 0:06:38.000 ---> 0:06:41.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, they were heavy as shit. He just manhandle them?
[ 0:06:41.000 ---> 0:06:51.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that's really hard to do those things. I do them with these little 25 pound ones, and it's hard to do. And the longer the handle, more difficult it is to maneuver.
[ 0:06:51.000 ---> 0:06:54.000 ] Speaker A : You put them behind your head and do them like shield casting.
[ 0:06:54.000 ---> 0:06:54.000 ] Speaker C : You do this?
[ 0:06:54.000 ---> 0:06:56.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, that's it.
[ 0:06:56.000 ---> 0:07:10.000 ] Speaker C : Then I do these. I do a bunch of different ones with it, but it's a very weird kind of strength. And when you watch him do it, it's like he must have been spectacularly strong. He was a legit wrestler, amateur wrestler.
[ 0:07:10.000 ---> 0:07:16.000 ] Speaker A : Oh, yeah. Pan Am champion. I can't. He had a bunch of other, I.
[ 0:07:16.000 ---> 0:07:27.000 ] Speaker C : Mean, think about how many real legit. Kurt Angle is a great example. Kurt Angle wins the gold medal with a broken neck. Won a gold medal in the Olympics with a broken neck.
[ 0:07:28.000 ---> 0:07:36.000 ] Speaker A : Dude, I'm in the ring with Kurt, and we go to squarf. He gets down an amateur stance. His eyes roll back in his head like a shark. I'm looking at him going, brother.
