- Once the seat of the Roman Empire, Italy is now home to a surprisingly robust yet temperamental economy. In a perverse kind of way, italy is actually the perfect national economy as a case study. Will the results be the same for other economies around the world?
- Italy found itself in a very similar position to Japan and Germany at the end of World War II. Like these countries, they benefited heavily from the Allied money flowing in from the United States. But perhaps a bigger, more hidden stimulus came from a war that was happening on the other side of the world. The Korean War indirectly butted heads between capitalism and communism.
- Italy's second wave of economic prosperity was heavily influenced by other countries'value adding industries. The country still has a very, very high level of national debt, in part due to similar reasons as Greece. A large hindrance on the Italian economy these days is how hard it is to do business with.
- Italy has a very clear gradient of wealthy areas to poorer areas as you move from north to south. This makes the already temperamental government that much harder to run. An aging population and overly rigid business culture may prove just as detrimental in Italy as it has in Japan.
