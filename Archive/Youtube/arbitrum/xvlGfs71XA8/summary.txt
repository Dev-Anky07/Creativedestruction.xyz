- The FORDA team is joined today by Christian Andy from Arbitram Offchain Labs. They will talk about how FORDA can help make sure your protocols are as secure as possible.
- Ford is presenting a deck today on how products can use FORDA to make sure their protocols on the smart contract level are secure. Hacks are still happening pretty much every week and millions of dollars are being lost. We'll talk a little bit about some of the hacks that happened over the last few months and then jump into how Ford can help to secure protocols.
- Web Three is getting hacked. This is not just leading to a lot of losses but also could potentially lead to more regulations. A lot of assets at risk. We need to do a better job on securing Web Three.
- Attack in web three are not atomic. They usually follow a set of attack stages that the attacker goes through from funding preparation, exploitation, and money laundering. Using Ether Scan, we can essentially simulate locally invocation of that attacker contract.
- Inverse. One question around what protective action could a protocol take, maybe in the context of Inverse. Not just smart contract audits. It is also utilization of template libraries. You have to think about monitoring and even potentially insurance against the assets that you hold.
- Attack on Ronan Bridge wasn't noticed for six days. Even when an attack has successfully been completed, it is important to identify that attack because there's still residual risk that your users may be exposed to. We have to think about comprehensive security strategy.
- There is an established methodology that allows you to identify risk in a systematic way and that is essentially threat modeling. Once you identify the risks and prioritize them, ask yourself the question, how do I mitigate the risk? And that's really good opportunities to put monitoring in place.
- There's no cost to the threat detection kits today. You can subscribe to these email, Slack, Discord, Telegram and Webhooks. Monitoring does not replace auditing. It is again a step for a comprehensive security approach.
- Christian: Custom bot development is permissionless. A bot is essentially a piece of JavaScript TypeScript or Python code that is then deployed onto the scan node. It is able to utilize external data sources and services. And if you subscribe to the bot, then you get immediately notified.
- We got a question from Franklin A four seven. Any guidance on developing a detection bot for someone that's maybe less sort of technically inclined? Once you have developed it, you have tested it against live transactions. And alerts will start getting emitted.
- The detection bot wizard was deployed about a month ago. Allows you to take bots that require some customization and configure them through this particular app. A bot is being generated in the background and then deployed onto the Ford network. How much more usage is a front end kind of facing tool like this going to get?
- The easiest way to start using FORDA is with threat detection kits. The second easiest way is to use a bot wizard. The last thing that you really need to think about is the incident response. If an incident happens while you're not prepared, it's going to be very difficult to handle.
- Thank you, guys. Andy, Christian, obviously for coming on today again. Been very informative, especially with what's going on in Crypto now. And yeah, we'll see you guys next time.
