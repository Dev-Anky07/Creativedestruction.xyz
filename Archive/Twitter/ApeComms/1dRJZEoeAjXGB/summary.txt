- Acom: Do we want to let people find their way in here? Acom: If it's copyright free, then go right ahead and play it. Let's just keep my fingers crossed here that it's like good for the entire community.
- Play apecoin soundtrack. Less than a minute. We're going to see how it feels, see how people feel about it. Now I can't even hear it. It's a joke.
- This is Apecoin community hour. We are well past number 52. Well over a year into these stages. Working on delivering some special election coverage and supporting some other content creators in the ecosystem. A lot of fun, a lot of serious work behind the scenes to be done.
- SSP: We are an informal group of highly motivated and active members of the apecoin community. Everything we discussed is our own personal opinion, not representative of the Apecoin foundation. It seems like two weeks ago is when we should have started some of this conversation, he says.
- Dim is here from Metaverse working group nominees. He's putting in a bunch of work behind the scenes. Find the right soundtrack for your disclaimer. Still lost behind the Apecom's account? Dim is here to help.
- Aaron: TFG is here, who is also running for Metaverse Steward. I was giving him the big tour. I won't talk about my special counsel run until next week. It's the community hour, so who knows what will come up?
- All of the candidates for the Dow Award have been announced. Here are five questions to get to know them better. In 2024, I would love to see apecoin with one of the biggest brands. Huge congratulations and best of luck to all the nominees.
- What inspired you to run for the stewardship position of the Metaverse working group? I think we are in a pivotal moment for the DAO. We need to go and get the builders, the content creators, the people that can actually make the TaO. apecoin can be an edge for them in their adoption.
- There is still 0% of apecoin. The main goal is to be the backbone of web three. The other point that I would love with this group, one of this goal would be IRL.
- What do you think makes the metaverse working group worth being funded by the Dow? Please. We are in a pivotal moment, and we can't just wait for people to come with their project and ask for funding. We need to bring people to the Dow.
- What sort of a budget do you think is needed to get all of this done? And just to quantify it, let's talk about over the next year. To me, this is something that will actually draw within the first few weeks in the position.
- What sort of initiatives do you hope to see supported through the metaverse working group? You can take any idea, basically, and depending on the budget and what people thinks is good to actually spend on these kind of initiatives. But I think the rich, we can accomplish so much even with a tiny budget.
- All right, well, that's it. That's pretty much all the questions, too that we went through with our guests yesterday. I do want to keep going around and saying hello. Looking forward to hearing from dim and the other nominees.
- There were some recent proposals approved. Would you want to keep them fresh, keep them in the discussion? Keep it simple and then hopefully we'll be able to deliver more. I just want to make sure we're not burning out the core team.
- Daniel is in Lisbon tonight. Congrats on the proposal and excited to share it at some point. Who's behind it right now? I'm just curious.
- A little bit about thank ape version two. Love it. Both previously approved authors have made a pretty big impact in the ecosystem. Going to be exciting. All members of the Dow. Love you all.
- All right. We got a few more people and then we'll get into more of a free flowing discussion. As much as we all want to aspire to these things, we also have to rein in our aspirations. Let's get straight to people's platforms.
- Good morning. Appreciate the spaces that you guys did Yesterday as well. Tiger, every time you come up on stage, you're building your brand. Next time you see Tiger on the timeline, just know she'll shut you right down.
- "I just hope we keep this energy going after elections is over. How can we get that consistency and harness this throughout the entirety of 2024? " "I know the answer, but I can't say it until after the election is over "
- We have this discussion every election cycle now. Everybody's in the discussion, everybody's creating the content. But then two months, two and a half months later, nothing. This is going to be potentially our third time unless we've solved it.
- Apecoms team member Amp is one of the governance stewards currently in the incumbent election. Double first. This is the first time for a governance steward position coming up. How's it feel? It feels great.
- SSP: Imagine if we had an election chain. Ape chain is definitely one of the current discussions. We've got two proposals now, small update. So, SSP, any thoughts on this breaking news?
- Don't hesitate to start the AIP process on the apecoms forum. There is no shortage of ideas in process, though, so keep them coming. If something goes up on that forum, people do tend to look at it with a little bit more seriousness.
- All right, we've obviously got the Elections going on. It looks like we ended up with several staking proposals. Anybody got any thoughts on SSP? Do we want to talk about that? At the end of the day, Friday community hour, everybody, please hit that purple button.
- Mochaverse tweeted out that they're increasing the allocation of ape to the moch averse community up to 6 million. I asked them in discord, why? Can you give us a reason for this? And at the end of the day, they basically just said to balance the voting out there, they wanted to increase the allocation.
- Mochaverse is up to about 6.8 million on their delegated. Machi has gone down a little bit. Currently it is one apecoin, one vote. An AIP is snaking through the system that might address voting.
- The vote per ape has become more expensive. How do we get more small delegates growing? Sometimes delegations don't work, sometimes people become inactive. And then we truly become the kind of culture with the entire web three user base behind it.
- Some automations can be put in place. You can pick a different delegate depending on which type of proposal it is. If a delegate becomes inactive, there is some automation for that as well. If we wanted to get into really custom levels of voting and automation, it might require that we go away from snapshot.
- Whenever there's an increase in participation in apecoin, Dow or another Dow is a net positive. One of the main challenges and fears people have is that by being a small voter like myself, does that mean that I lose my say? There's always, ever two ways to approach any problem ever, there's frustration and complaining about it, or working together towards a solution.
- The mochaverse vote would need to stipulate a definition of consensus. People in the community are pushing for incentives to vote for, sorry, to allow individual voters to get more incentives. The delegation conversation is going to be interesting and will continue.
- This is Apecoms community hour every Friday. We run apecoms Monday, Wednesday, Friday at noon Pacific. Community hour can sometimes go a bit longer than usual. Not everything gets sorted out here, but it's good to have the conversations.
- I don't actually have much to say about the delegations. I'm actually in this position of learning, listening to everybody. Don't take it too personally when in the past I've maybe seemed combative about the idea of an apecoms delegation.
- Apecoin token delegation has 131,000. Hodler collective has, which is great. Let's make sure we got a voice in the ecosystem. I think everything is just difficult to navigate, especially if you're not spending that much time in here.
- Bradley: I don't think that there's any sort of silver bullet. It's probably going to be multiple levers as far as how or if we wanted to address any of that. So I think it's worthwhile, but I'm sort of neutral.
- The ve or vote escrowed model is a great model, I think, to explore. The longer you lock, the more power that eight point has to vote. Skin in the game can also be defined as a function of both that value as well as how long you've held it.
- "I am 100% for more delegations. I think that we need to reach out to more communities and make stuff happen " There needs to be a naturally aligned incentive for users to want to lock their tokens, usually for money. We're going into Defi based voting.
- If you're locking up, it's not just for governance or for voting, but it's something that you do get as an added benefit. To get any of these things through, you're going to have to convince the large delegations to give up their power.
- The official forum was discussing the financial capital versus social capital. The apecoin Dow is a long way away from that in terms of what Animok is doing at mochaverse. There's a strong possibility we're going to be learning from them on certain aspects of this.
- The goal moving forward for something like this and maybe other proposals, is to host your own spaces and invite people who aren't normally in apecoin ecosystem. Can we remind the audience that even on discourse, we do have, like an automatic translator?
- I got a sound, too. I got spooky sounds. You want me to give, like, negative feedback on. Who was it? Meme brains. You can record some yourself. You'll get some good ones going.
- You can vote for the Metaverse working group stewards. Some of the election polls are open now. There are three aips up for vote as well this week. One of them would allow proposals to continue to go up during the election process.
- Daniel: Vengape was created with a simple idea in mind. People deserve to be rewarded for the contributions that we make to this DaO. When we are rewarded, the impact will be greater efficiency, greater utility, greater value for the DAO. Phase two of Vankape is soliciting feedback now.
- How many beers did you buy with your grant? None because I haven't been paid for it yet. We fund when it's been demonstrated that value is contributed. There is a process around that and that's valuable for the Dow.
- The thank ape prop house system gives grants to charities. It's nice that there are people who are within the ecosystem who start from 100. Not everyone should be attempting to go and get a benefit in the same way. Finding a place for everyone to thrive and make the ecosystem.
- I would like to see thank ape do events like summer camp where every single person or as many as we can just sort of gets voted and attributed some kind of award. There are various ways to share it with the community, but share with the board as well. It's really important to continue to find meaningful ways to bring together, reward, and partner with community.
- The bay apes got something cooking. You got mic flashes. You don't even know what mic flashes are? We're not funded like that, G. Dude, you can make it out of foam core and a printer and some glue gun. We're going to have to find funding.
- We're at the top of the hour here again. How are you feeling? I'm feeling fine. I haven't even heard from mocha today. If you want to quickly go to them before we think about wrapping up.
- Uzi: One person can change the sentiment of a big delegate or a big delegation. He says you don't need 10 million ape coins to make a difference if you have that one voice. Uzi: As long as it's not broken, we don't try and fix it.
- The word grant for me is almost know it's a non exchange transaction. What we actually are doing over here is not really a grant, but more of a contract. The only way we're going to increase the value of apecoin is by creating value through these proposals.
- When it comes to bend out, having our toe can stake them. How does that work? Do I have to do any type of extra steps? If you miss the Tuesday or so, we're really the Wednesday morning, you might miss that snapshot. To everyone involved in putting that together, to taking on all the guesswork seriously.
- On the 9 November, there was apecoin, dow official post on X which talked about saying that you can put forward proposals which are going to give financial contribution back to the Dow. Language is definitely important. People will think about words differently. If I do get elected, I think that'll be something I look to do pretty quickly.
- All right. What's up? You think about anything? I want to throw your thoughts in on any of the things we're discussing. This is community hour, so I'm letting one to hear what everyone else it. Love it.
- Semantics is always important. I would just like the community to maybe talking about semantics and even mindset is not necessarily think of the Dow as a startup. The Dow can basically help and promote and support and fund hundreds of startups within the ecosystem.
- SSP: How can we help other startups succeed in the ecosystem that directly bring value back to the treasury. There's some hidden gems in there, but there's also a risk of throwing money all over the place and not getting the right ROI. I think it deserves maybe a bit more discussion on discourse before.
- The Dow is still young, we're still figuring out what is the best for us. I'm thinking now maybe I should put options instead of like yes or no, so people can actually select the best. Right now I want to say that we keep working on education.
- SSP: I would love to see the Dow do more when it comes to charitable work. Bojangles: What is a grant? SSP: If we know that we have x amount of dollars as a Dow set aside for these various things, maybe that makes it easier.
- The best way to increase the charitable contribution would be to fund the ecosystem. The easiest way to fund more charity is to make the ecosystem more valuable. I think we're going to get it done in 2024.
- Avecom: People can put their names up for multiple roles in elections. The proposal is where the person cannot hold more than one role or being reelected to another role. If you have any suggestions about this, let me know.
- Papu: It's communication. The good communication with HRS committee. PR is a huge missing element. It could definitely use more highlighting in the ecosystem for different people. Looking forward to seeing you and more of the stages.
- The initial spirit of the DAO is to fund the new, the weird and the hard. A lot of that comes down to artistic things. Not everything needs to be funded, but you cannot look past the arts. If you do, it's at the peril of the Dow.
- Aaron Carroll: Sometimes you just got to be compliant. If I get elected to special counsel, I do not guarantee that I will sign the current NDA as it stands. Carroll: Transparency is key and it has to be weighed with security.
- When I get elected, I will definitely work with all bodies in the council because I do have a little bit experience in marketing. What if we reached out to some animal organizations that's into saving apes in the wild. We're having a discussion. Feel free to jump in during the discussion.
- "We want to grow this token or this coin. We want to get this coin out to more people and not feel like it's just exclusive, right, to this club " There are a lot of blockchain games that are being developed. To do that, it's going to take outsiders coming in and then bringing other communities in.
- We need Apekin nfts. We need to get Annie to make us some images for nfts and then embed an ape coin in there. You don't need to own NFTs. All your people that is from your club can be a part of our Apecoin Dow. Let's do it.
- Aaron Dow: The purpose of having lawyers at all is to help us be more successful. He says when you get big and successful, you get attacked. He urges other authors to keep the discussion collaborative. Dow: We want apecoin to succeed.
- Board members say lawyers have been too adversarial with the AIP authors. While what I'm saying sounds adversarial, it's not. It means that the lawyers should be there to protect and advise, but not to run the Dow.
- SSP: I agree for the lawyer part it do have to have a better communication. Working group zero was not hard to work with at all. I was hoping for a bit more election talk as well, but today's committee hour will have all weekend and all next week to be talking elections.
- "I just wanted to say some nice things as we wound out. I see some people coming out to vote for me that obviously have caught me on some stages or whatnot " shout out to all those people for voting. Let's wind it down.
- I would love to have some kind of official position at least like minimum supporting me in some way so I can keep doing it in more official capacity. Most likely I'm really going strong onto obviously communication in any kind of promotion ways.
- Vulcan working with Brazy on a calendar, and SSP is helping out. Will include content from all of the different content creators who are hosting election content. No, I'm not sending out no physical calendars. That'll be next year.
