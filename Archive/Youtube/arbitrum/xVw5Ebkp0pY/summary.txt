- We will be going through and answering questions that we got from Twitter. We got a lot of questions covering a pretty wide range of topics. We'll get to whatever we can. Harry, you want to give your Intro? AJ. Director of Strategy and Partnerships, focused on building up the ecosystem.
- In terms of interacting within Arbitrum itself, it will sort of look and feel exactly like using ethereum. At most in order to start using Arbitrum, you have to do a single layer one transaction. As the layer two ecosystem emerges, you'll have more direct ways of getting onboarded.
- What are some of the more unknown benefits that Arbitram can offer and which of these is the most underlooked? What else does Arbitram offer other than just gas savings?
- Fast sequencing of transactions. Using Arbitrum as an L two with the sequencer chain. Biggest one on our roadmap is WebAssembly support. Once layer two emerges, you really do get the permissionless innovation thing even on the protocol level.
- Are there any easy to use tools for devs to learn to migrate their contracts over to Arbitram? There are five or six differences in terms of solidity operations between what you expect on layer one and what happens on layer two. And this is something we've gotten a lot of positive feedback from developers who've using Arbitrum.
- E 2.0 is not a single monolithic thing, it's a series of phases. Phase one is only really useful if you're using roll ups. Eventually on the long term Ethereum roadmap, I think they've even pivoted back and forth on whether or not phase two is even going to be worth it.
- In the future, our roadmap will take us to future products where there are stronger privacy guarantees. Right now we're on a roll up based product. There's a lot of cool stuff to explore there. This is one of these things that just hasn't really sunk in yet in the community at large.
- Bridging assets works on Arbitrum. Arbitrum can support any token standard, including token standard that don't even exist yet. There will be an NFT bridge probably it'll be out when we initially do our main net launch. If not, someone could just build their own.
- The graph is basically just a system for indexing and query data on the ethereum blockchain. Arbitrum supports it. We've used it in a number of DApps that we've used in our testnet. We use it in fact for our block explorer so we can confirm Arbitram supports the graph.
- With applications migrating to L Two, having chain link migrate with them is kind of foundationally extremely important. L Two transition will provide the opportunity to make a lot of types of data feeds feasible. Having Oracles be a key part of the interoperability layer between kind of Ethereum and Arbitrum is an area that kind of has me pretty excited.
- Stephen, I'm co founder and CEO of Offchain Labs. I got into the crypto space around 2013 and together with Ed and some others at Princeton, I wrote a textbook on cryptocurrencies. Ed, do you want to take it from there?
-  ed Felton is the third co founder of Offchain Labs and chief scientist. Started working on cryptocurrency blockchain research around 2013. Has done three tours of duty in the US. Government, most notably in the White House. Has been since for almost a year and a half, full time at the company.
- Arbitrum's sequencer technology is going to be really helpful when it comes to dealing with front running and this mev extraction problem. The sequencer will determine the order of transactions rather than whatever miner happens to make a block. Over time, we'll be transitioning to a set of technologies that let us decentralize the sequencer.
- Most of our efforts are really focused on figuring out what developers and DApps need for deployment on Arbitrum. As we get closer to Main net launch, we're going to have a lot of announcements around different sort of infrastructure providers that we're working with to help sort of bootstrap the ecosystem.
- We had a number of questions asking about sort of the trade offs between Arbitrum and some other systems. Polygon, ZK Stink got mentioned, optimism was mentioned. To really sufficiently go into this takes a while, as in probably like a semester.
- Polygon is another project, Polygon. They're like building all these a wide range, like a whole layer two suite. How that compares to Arbitrum and what are the trade offs between them.
- Arbitram is compatible with EVM smart contracts on the bytecode level. In both systems you move execution off chain. Costs of running Arbitrum are very close to the metal. No one's put out a system that can take arbitrary smart contract computation.
- Questions about generally how Arbitram uses multi round proofs and comparisons with that versus sort of single round fraud proofs. At some point we'll announce a separate session where we kind of focus on this exact thing.
- There are a bunch of different solutions being worked on right now in terms of kind of layer two scalability. The long term vision is in no way ever going to be a single roll up chain. There's a lot of room for different approaches that have different pros and cons to each other.
- The name comes from arbitration. Not like arbitrage or arbitrary or any of that. It was based around the way that challenges are resolved by Ethereum mediating a dispute between different validators. We try to avoid that for things like variable names and contract names.
- Harry: What is the most surprising thing you've discovered while building Arbitrum? Ed: What thing that you found harder to implement than it looked in theory? I would love to ask this to every project.
- For an L two chain that's trying to relatively live interact with data that's being posted on Ethereum, you have to really carefully deal with reorgs. It's a really subtle problem and took us a while to figure out.
- The Reality Hitter team has 24 hours coverage for all things. Who is the biggest workaholic among the team? I would say I might have to go with Harry, because sometimes he just doesn't sleep.
- Who's your biggest Twitter troll? Right? No one asked who's behind the sort of some of the company Tweet accounts. Who is your coolest dev? That's a good question for next time.
- Linkies asks, if you were trying to impress somebody, what aspect of the Arbitrage protocol would you describe to them? Stephen: The most impressive part is the fact that it just works with all the tooling you already use.
- What are some of the interesting things that Arbitram has in mind for future roadmaps? We're going to be doing a ton of stuff once we're launched and established on main net. There's an open field.
- We'll be doing another one of these same time next week. And we will answer a number of the questions that we got on Twitter. The other thing to say is we are hiring. For anyone listening, if you are interested, please reach out to us.
- A lot of you are asking when we will launch our main net. I'm not going to say a specific date right now. When we announce a main net date, we will deliver on that date. And, yeah, just to reiterate what Daniel said, we are hiring.
