-  TFG is hosting a live streaming event. The event is aimed at the Asian community. It has been delayed due to issues loading from a browser instance. TFG apologizes for the delay and thanks everyone for their support.
- I'm here because we're at a tipping point as a species and how we work together. This is a pivotal time, just as pivotal as the Renaissance period was. If we do this right, apecoin Dow can be at the forefront of that.
- Raymond: I've been in the space since 2021, late 21, kind of FoMod in on the top there and just rode this down. What I want to do is bring more creators to the space, right. And sort of bring AIps that are going to create cool products. That's why I'm running for this.
- One of my new favorite people, Shotgun Toby. And we can all look forward to these Chinese spaces that you and I are talking about building up together across the aggregate space. We are very invested in the Filipino community, including up to your leadership there in terms of affiliations. Let's go.
- Toby is running for marketing and communications, working group steward. Currently handles operations and special projects and the Socials of boring Security. Also active in the IRL web three scene and events here in Manila. His goal is to give Apecoin the attention and spotlight that it deserves.
- But very much wanted to thank everybody who's here in the audience, especially now at the end here. I do think that we all need to strive to work together more and build up ourselves. Whether I'm elected or not, it's time to get these things put together.
