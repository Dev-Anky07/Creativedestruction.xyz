- We will be starting the much asked for and much praised and applauded idea of having a starting show in languages in the Asian region. More so more evolved and we'll try to make a hard time of the stop in the future.
- I'm going to start staging some of our hosts, but before we get into too much chatter and whatnot, I do want to stipulate a few things. This is going to be very fledgling, as usual, more so, perhaps. And it's a journey we're building in public.
- Today we will discuss this week's improvement proposals that are up for vote. Popul has arranged some questions which have now appeared in the Ugg Energy group chat. The idea is to make people feel welcome and celebrate this. The criticisms are welcome, but let's make it constructive and helpful in tone.
- Today is my first day hosting here. The rest of time today the first hour will be using Chinese. If you don't know who is winning, please see on the Painted and Haninah. Please help each of the nominations to share their painted and on the portfolio.
- Apopio will be asking you Chinese and peace answering Chinese. Once we finish all the Chinese nomination, if we still have time we can invite more English speaker to the space. Always welcome to translate your English to Chinese.
- Each of you have three minutes to answer each question. Be careful, watch the timer because I will use the timer as well. And thank you to Helena in the back channels who's helping out.
- Very great to translate your English to Chinese. But don't be afraid to mix some of the English, it's okay too. It's most important to just share yourself. Let's go. One, two. I'll introduce myself in Chinese a bit and maybe later on in the part later.
- So sorry Nihau washi shotgun toby xiang chong won washer philippine Run. How Jesus Bible coin. Mockham the mocker versus shouldn't he has Jesus. Kenya. You can know that they got banjo father.
- Okay so water yan ting xi rang ape coin taught Changshang. No boys, no jinn. Sand. You pretty good. Improve. I had to move on.
- Next hour will be hours for English. Scavenger hunt. Feel free to take your time here. I'm so happy because we actually inside 1 hour.
- 1230 Gan mocker hio so xiang Wakui feng shiang DA guy so dear. Speaking male Japanese or female Japanese is very different. This was again meant to be a celebration of us coming together. This is a stepping stone to what can be some greatness and further greatness.
- "My top priority to address would be exactly that, building these bridges. Building bridges and building the tool layer that needs to exist between all of us internationally as users and the ultimate user experience of the Web three space "
- I want to let you guys have a chance to introduce yourselves. We do have AIP authors, and if you'd like to do it, if not, I can lead with these questions. Does that sound all right to everybody? If anyone has any objections, please raise them.
- So let's just get do you cryptologically, Chris? Do you have a hard exit time, for example? And Popple, we can do these questions. I think if people want to stay, then we will welcome them to do that again in English. That will be our program for today.
- But let's do the AIPS. There's only three, let's get them. And if anyone already answers a question in the Chinese piece, go down first. Later, please raise your hand and come up again. Chris, would you like to set up your interview?
- AIP 372 would allow for AIPS to go up for vote during the two weeks of special council elections. Voting does close on Wednesday at 06:00 p. m Pacific. AFP 372, happy to field any questions.
- No AIPS during elections feels like letting existing special counsel have a break and get paid for it while they're campaigning in order to be reelected. I think the idea is to level that playing field and keep the workflow going just like other nominees would have to do with their jobs.
- The AIP is aimed at respecting and honoring that all the other 27 candidates are probably running their own jobs. The idea is to say, look, just like everyone else, you still got to do your job. It wasn't at all targeting the SC in any way.
- Chris: I think it's very important to think about it from a community member point. I'm personally against AIPS at the same time as election. I call that metaverse indigestion, not digestible. Dim 100% agrees and shouts out to you for all you do in this space.
- And on the side we have the election. It is too much for people that are here from communities that are not maybe as involved, that don't have as much time. Maybe there is a better way to do it on those side, but community on community side, it's a lot.
- Helena has her hand up and she is actually a co host. She was involved in producing this today. Can you also help out with hand order and going to questions? I think it punctuates what we have set out to do here today, which is bridge two different language speaking communities.
- Translating into the Chinese written language is really quite a lot of work. I do think that perhaps passing this AIP could be good in the sense that, hey, we don't necessarily need to put two weeks of elections and also ape chain at the same time. It's not about translate, it's about understanding and the culture.
- In Japan, we say let's English. Lost in translation is a thing. Shouts out to all of us who greatly assist in making that happen. Aaron, what's good? What's poppin? And thank you for waiting.
- All cities proposal of the mentorship program to guide AIP authors in the process should and could include. Maybe we can do something to automate translations to help ease some of that burden going cross country. Anyways, that's my point. Thank you.
- The French from Quebec is actually more French than the French from France. We use a lot of English words. In Quebec, they translate everything we don't. Hope to meet you in Paris in the Sandbox offices.
- Aaron: The European yogurt is the best. I would say European and British beer is better than American beer with the live cultures. I do eat a lot of yogurt.
- I do also think that it would not be a bad thing for space hosts to limit speakers to a certain amount of time. In terms of the AIP process with the authors, it would be helpful to have more time. If we could demystify the admin review period.
- The nominations are proposals that need voting on. It might not be a bad thing if AIPS are delayed. It gives the new SCS the opportunity to have a look at them in the new year. And as people finish their takes, Popil, then you can direct the next person to the stage.
- Buwei: These are the things I really want to see and I think it's going to create good opportunities for people. The first one is the Mocha assembly for the tribe leaders. There needs to be a Mocha portal for the artists that are mochas there. And the last one is very important, it's called Mocha Nation.
- Joel: Today we both have laminations introduce themselves and also talk about if after elected and what could you be the top priority to address. How do you planning to improve the ecosystem between the Macawers and Acron Dao. You have to answer those two questions in the same time.
- Jason is running for the Special Council. Was actually with the Mochaverse back in 2023, in March even. Not heavily involved in the community side but the management side. Hopes to build a ripple effect and build a small blueprint for all the other communities.
- Just want to say if the AIP speaker, please, we move to the audience because I do want to bring more people to the stage. Are we going with all special counsel first or any order in particular? I think it's go by.
-  Meme Brains is a Dow activist and a lifelong entrepreneur. He believes that apecoin can lead the way on decentralization. As a special Council member, he must balance long term vision with short term actionables.
- Dows are here to stay. I'm involved at every level from the individual one on one DMing to former prime ministers of major countries. This is where I intend to spend my life. And if you vote me into special counsel, that's what you're getting.
- Helena ETH running for Apecoin Special Council. Helena believes ApeCoin is the best position Dow in the world to dominate metaverse gaming. Top priorities to address for collaboration between Mojaverse friends and Dao.
- So. Five minutes for both questions. Briefly introduce yourself, position you're running for and your vision for Apecoin Dow. Second question, what would be your top priority to address and how do you plan to improve the ecosystem. Timer starts now.
- Aaron Haber is running for special counsel in the Web Three system. Haber has been an entrepreneur and a comedian for the past 25 years. In the Dow, Haber successfully passed an AIP. He wants to move ahead with the evolution and reforming of the Dao by bringing everybody to the table.
- One of our AIP authors, Bearsnake, has arrived. I invite them to raise their hand, get up on stage and jump into this conversation. If you have a hard stop time, we can make adjustments. Again, apologies to anybody who's dealing with the disruptions here.
- When you're hearing all these candidates, please remember that they're going to work as a team. And that's why I say, okay, let me represent smaller voices. Even if you're a big delegate, end of the day, you're made up of the smaller delegates.
- Next up. Bouvet. If you could go down the stage so we could make room for the other speakers. I think it was a little bit unfair that we only gave him three minutes because he was out of sync. This structure will assist us and inform everybody who's doing this as well moving forward.
- Populan: Bearsnake has arrived and they are the author of what was noted as a very big AIP that could deserve all kinds of discussion and attention. Uzi: We want to respect the time for each nomination, but at the same time, we want to expect our AIP speaker as well.
- Battle for Goblin Town is 90% done. Inspired by Settlers of Catan. First proper Ape coin sync for a game. An open edition mint for anyone to come play. 50% of the upside in perpetuity to back across the Dow ecosystem.
- We were asked to submit a proposal to the Apecoin Dow by the special counsel. What are people looking for from the Metaverse working group? Steward. Is it that big game, the next dookie dash more focus on building that out or finding that?
- There will be an ongoing space, which is the Metaverse Working Group Steward and Marketing comm stewards and ongoing added working groups. Look for these added spaces, which are more discussion based and workshops based for all of us to get together in. In my opinion, NFTs need to be the prize.
- I really appreciate you guys getting into like that. It can be often seen as flood, but I'll always say it is the process that removes dross and makes the gold more apparent and shine. Well answered and great questions. Sharp, insightful. And we do have hands.
- Snake, I have a question for you about Apecoin. How are you planning to use, if at all, apecoin in your development? And also, I want to thank you for actually putting AIP.
- The game is pixel based. Part of why the money that we're asking for is to have a team of developers who are live updating the game. If elected, I'll just reintroduce the structures that exist in motion pictures. The relationship is publisher to studio.
-  Legends of the Mara hv Dookie Rec League Galaxy Fight Club. Are you considering, can you participate as an asset holder versus a player? If this doesn't pass, would you be interested in putting up the AIP again in a way that it was done as getting investment versus a grant?
- The prize pool is split across three seasons and it's across a couple of different categories. Having a set prize pool really sort of gets everybody on the same page as what effort to put in. We're allowing people to be more responsible with how they play the game.
- Great. We are going to cap it because we do have people that have been asked to wait here. If you have a preference, hit me Wednesday, DM me and we'll figure it out. I hope it passes. If it doesn't, it's all good. Let's make it win.
- And here's the other thing, too. Monetizing my experience and then facing regulatory landscape, which is just always changing. All of those things are being sussed out behind the scenes that have a huge play on gaming. We're going to move over bearsnake and look for Wednesdays working group.
- We built a game, specifically we built push forward. What web three games look like. There's going to be a lot of different categories. I hope we can bring some value to the apecoin ecosystem. If not, no harm, no foul. The game will launch anyway.
- Toby: I'm running for special Aid council here. If I got elected, I will be out there champion the apecoin as far as being inclusive to all communities. Raymond: There's a huge perception problem, right? Huge perception problem.
- So do you want me to move to next? Shaka. Do we still have anyone for special counsel right now? Because the list we have going up next is going to be. me, Lore, big Bull TFG, then Snowflake. Let's get down.
- Two questions, five minutes. Purple, I can't hear you interrupting. Can you tell me what you want me to respond? Second question will be, what's your priority? How you consulting to improve the ecosystem between megawers and the acronym. The two questions inside, five minute P star.
-  TFG requested if he could go first, just since gaming is, like, the topic that's been being discussed. Snowflake then use snowflake. You'll be getting five minutes and you can insert across the different positions what you want to share.
- Apecoin Dow needs someone who is experienced in the gaming Web Three and metaverse worlds. With a bull market on the horizon, it is time for us to make moves. I just want to get to work. Please vote for me if you guys want to see success.
- Shirkan: What's stopping you from doing it right now? We have this opportunity to you have one Apecoin. Just put your ideas there. You don't need to vote for the position. Just do it.
- Toby is running for marketing and Communications working group steward. His vision for Apecoin is for it to really get the attention and spotlight that it deserves both outwards, globally and inwards from its holders. He says making it a fun and easier experience for holders to participate in the Dao will make it easier to build the brand.
- Next up, we're going to have Lorelord popular. If we can make those rails that make accommodating non English communities way easier, then we can have stronger engagement across all the members. And that will just make things easier for everyone.
- "I'm running for steward of marketing. I really want to see a lot of web two and web three activations. I want people to see Apecoin at Starbucks, at Barnes and Nobles. I'd also love to see some guerrilla marketing campaigns. Things that are different "
- Big Bell is running for Governance Steward in the Governance Working Group. He sees three main areas expanding the community engagement, expanding the financial sustainability and expand the technical leadership innovation.
- Mockaverse is a great model template for other communities to follow to develop more advanced delegation models. If we bridge well between the two, one plus one can end up becoming greater. The whole is greater than some of its parts.
- South African, also British. I'm a managing director in a billion pound business. Also a co owner of an art gallery where we've tokenized traditional art. I felt that all my skill set and my experience will allow me to steward and be an SC. That ultimately creates a quicker, better and faster dow.
- I'm one of the candidates for governance stewards. I have been an early evangelist of NFTs since 2020 from India. If elected, what would be your top priority to address and how do you plan to improve the ecosystem between Mochaverse and Apecoin Dao?
- Gregory is a nominee for the role of the metaverse working group steward in Apecoin Dow. His top priority is strengthening the bond between Mochaverse and ApeCoin Dao. With strategic initiatives, effective communication, and a commitment to mutual growth, we can create a thriving ecosystem.
- SSP is running for Special Counsel on a single issue as far as Apecoin Dow goes. Has been active in the Apecoms team for over 500 days. Recently, we became the official communications arm of ApeCoin Dow. Is now in a race to become the metaverse Working Group steward.
- My single issue is put the special council back to what it was, which is a board. The special counsel over the last year has grown in roles and responsibilities, and I think they're unrealistic in expectations. I think it opens up the whole space for us as a community to actually direct which way the Dow goes.
- You're just away on the timer. You have a timer? I don't, no. Okay, so the next one will be and also seems like tutoring is so annoying. So if don't mind I would like to just set my own timer if it's okay.
- Poppy is running for marketing communications. Her main focus is education inside the Dao. She also supports the idea about the AIP fee five one. And thank you for everybody coming to my host.
- Robert: We don't have a scripted ending typically but we typically try to encourage people to explore the ideas of convening together and putting structure to that. I would really love if we could work more together on collaborating and putting space schedules and things together.
- If you tap into this space every week, you get Mocha XP, right? This goes towards your reputation. And it could be something that Apecoin could use right in the future. It's really a matter of bandwidth and I think it'll come down to regioning and whatnot.
- I hope everybody who applied get out of that chair and really also travel around, really communicate with builders. There is no stipulated definition of what this role is. It needs to be stipulated us through these discussions. I caution against using imperatives and stipulating things which haven't been stipulated.
- GM: What do you guys see as a most probably future collab between Apecoin, Dow and Mochawasdao? GM: It's obvious that certain people get more airtime, others don't. It becomes resentful and resentment breeds capitulation. Let's just make sure that we're all being conscious of who's getting time.
- Apecom Spaces hosts give props to all the Spaces hosts. The space grew because DJs, characters and artists were not just taking care of each other, but having fun in all. We are hoping to do a Wednesday show which would an ongoing show. Have fun, be safe. Do community.
