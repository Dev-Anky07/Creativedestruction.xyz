- Bartek Stardy is coming at you from the perspective of city government and especially governance within the context of a smaller city. I'm going to speak for about 2025 minutes. Just have about 15 slides and then we can have a discussion.
- I'm the Director of Housing Initiatives for the city of Kingston, New York. It's about 90 minutes north of New York City. Governance has really changed a lot during and after COVID. There's a lot of experimentation here right now.
- Kingston has a housing crisis. The annual home price increases is about 30% year over year. The rental vacancy rate is 1.5%. Local government governance process can seem slow. However, there are certain outreach methods that can pretty effectively bridge the gap.
- Decentralizing governance enables people to participate more directly in governance process. It increases efficiency and responsiveness of government. Even attempting some level of decentralized governance does improve the outcome of any policy that is being created.
- The Common Council is the legislative body of the city of Kingston. 99% of items that get out of committee are passed by the common council. There's also this informal governance process that happens before the legislation. This is called community outreach.
-  Kingston recently became the first upstate city to adopt rent control in New York. New York has a framework for red control the state, but as a municipality, you have to opt into that. This was a big vote, but the impact is somewhat limited.
- The city of Kingston's current zoning code was completed in 1963. The mayor made the decision to do a complete redo in 2018. Overly restrictive zoning makes it very difficult to build new housing. Outdated zoning leads to bad decision and very poor urban planning.
- The city started with a visioning process last fall. Second draft was released this Monday. Another round of input this month, and then that will get us to a final draft. There's still criticism that the outreach so far has not been intentional.
- Sandy Barjek: Kingston's City Hall fell out of use in the early 90s. Cyber Republic is an AI platform that facilitates citizen assemblies. I'm going to ask people to ask their questions.
- There's a bunch of user research methodologies and practices that always struggle in the same point. How do we make people show up so that they can use our product and give us feedback? Sandy's suggestion of throwing a party is not that weird.
- Do you think the sexiness level of the issue is the major factor that influences people showing up and participating on it? I think it's all about the framing as well. Helping a population understand how politics works in the longer term and how policy initiatives will impact them ten years from now.
- Bardrick: Where is the filter to which voices are heard or not, and how do you guarantee that there's enough diversity on the voices being heard? Unless you do outreach to that group, they're often just not going to be part of the voices.
- Cindy Go: Our research team, if you will, is not diverse. How do we fix that? Cindy Go: We need to be intentional about including people. We should reach out to specific groups of people that maybe don't have as much accessibility to enter the spaces.
