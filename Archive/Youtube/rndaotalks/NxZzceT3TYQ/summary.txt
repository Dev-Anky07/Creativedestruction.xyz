- Dow Innovation Center focuses on keeping research around Dao governance and operations. Bart is a leader of the beyond budgeting movement. Will share some of the lessons to make corporations more agile. As we scale and DAOs become more complex and hopefully not more cumbersome.
- Bart Kohn will talk to you about Beyond Budgeting. Kohn has been working with the concept for more than 25 years. He will discuss the problems with traditional management, including budgeting. Also talk about some exciting cases before we go to the main case.
- Oxford Dictionary defines control as the power to influence or direct people's behavior. It basically means controlling people and controlling the future. The two main assumptions behind traditional management are that you can't trust people and the future is predictable and planable.
- Peter Drucker: Most management is about making it difficult for people to do their job. Russell Aikoff compared corporate planning with a ritual rain dance. Management innovation is about better performance defined in the right way. It is good news for brave companies who dare to embrace this kind of innovation.
- Budgets can stimulate what I would call unethical behaviors. Too high up budgets can prevent us from doing stuff that we probably should have done. To define good performance as hitting the budget numbers is a narrow, mechanical way of defining performance. We need a richer, broader performance language.
- Old management technology was invented roughly 100 years ago. The inventor was Mr. James O. McKinsey, the founder of McKinsey Consulting. Today this way of thinking is doing exactly the opposite. It has become more of a barrier than a support for getting out the best possible performance.
- The roundabout is not just more efficient, it's also safer and actually it has lower lifetime cost. To drive in a roundabout we need more competence and going back to our organizations, everything we need to leave behind of traditional management.
- Performance management is a label that fits nicely when we talk about a traffic light. But in the roundabout it is about something else. It is about creating conditions for great performance to take place. Organizations need more self regulating management models.
- The other reality we need to reflect on is not external, it's internal. What kind of people view we have must also have a big impact on how we design our management model. What we need on the leadership side is to become more purpose based, more values based. And there has to be more transparency.
- We are addressing both leadership principles and management processes. What must be the implications for the rhythm, for how we set targets, plan and forecast? Allocate resources, evaluate performance and reward performance. Coherence is a key word here in several dimensions.
- Budget is a resource allocation mechanism handing out bags of money to the organization on operational cost and investments. We should do these three things in three separate processes because these are different things. The separation allows us or opens up for a big improvement agenda.
- The way I'm seeing a lot of Dows starting to operate at the moment is with quarterly budgets. How would the event driven process be different from that? You get to budget four times a year, a lot more work, more pissed off people. You have to be braver.
- Most small organizations are born beyond budgeting. The question for small organizations should be how can you grow without ending up in the same misery. Miles, which I talked about, the Norwegian company, is one example. It's only possible if you are very conscious about it every day.
- Performance evaluation of course, starts with how you set targets. And hitting a budget number is very often a meaningless target. What are then the reward implications? The beyond budgeting recommendation is no individual bonus, but as much as possible a shared scheme throughout the company.
- The banker calls individual bonus a little bit of managerial laziness. Motivating people through mastery, autonomy, purpose and belonging takes leadership. Performance evaluation is very important. To me, the importance of that is actually not for the one receiving the bonus, but for the team overall.
- Can there be a stacking of budgeting or this kind of financial planning at incremental cadence? Absolutely. I think the most important is that it's more business driven and event driven and less calendar driven.
- I really enjoyed your questions here and I hope you still got something out of this. I just put the link to the Arendao Discord. I'll be sharing the slides there. If you can send them to me via email, I'll share it with everyone else in our Discord.
- Thank you very much again for your time. This is super interesting. Really appreciate you sharing your experience here. Good luck.
