- ACOM: Do we want to let people find their way in here? SSP: If it's copyright free, then go right ahead and play it. Let's just keep my fingers crossed here that it's like good for the entire community.
- The ve or vote escrowed model is a great model, I think, to explore. The longer you lock, the more power that eight point has to vote. Skin in the game can also be defined as a function of both that value as well as how long you've held it.
- DeFi: I am 100% for more delegations. There needs to be a naturally aligned incentive for users to want to lock their tokens, usually for money. We're really trying to get started by the beginning of this next year.
- If you're locking up, it's not just for governance or for voting, but it's something that you do get as an added benefit. To get any of these things through, you're going to have to convince the large delegations to give up their power.
- Some delegates run differently. The official forum was discussing the financial capital versus social capital. The apecoin Dow is a long way away from that in terms of what Animok is doing at Mochaverse. There's a strong possibility we're going to be learning from them on certain aspects of this.
- Vulcan working with Brazy on a calendar, and SSP is helping out. Will include content from all of the different content creators who are hosting election content. No, I'm not sending out no physical calendars. This is the Metaverse.
