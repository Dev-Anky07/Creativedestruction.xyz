[ 0:00:02.000 ---> 0:00:10.000 ] Speaker A : Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the great and powerful tony hinchcliffe, the biggest pro wrestling fan of the world. Totally appropriate that he's here today because we have the king.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker B : Whoa.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker A : We share a birthday. We share four letters of our last name. The fucking man. Hulk hogan.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker B : Do I need these things, brother, you don't have to.
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker A : I like them. They lock everybody in. They look. They look great with your durag.
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker B : Can't even hear you, man.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:31.000 ] Speaker A : You can't. Is it not on little crank chest test.
[ 0:00:31.000 ---> 0:00:31.000 ] Speaker B : Whoa.
[ 0:00:31.000 ---> 0:00:32.000 ] Speaker A : Here we go.
[ 0:00:32.000 ---> 0:00:34.000 ] Speaker B : Strong, brother. Thank you for having me here.
[ 0:00:35.000 ---> 0:00:35.000 ] Speaker C : Please.
[ 0:00:35.000 ---> 0:00:38.000 ] Speaker A : It's an honor. Great to see you, man.
[ 0:00:38.000 ---> 0:00:40.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. What's cracking?
[ 0:00:40.000 ---> 0:00:44.000 ] Speaker A : We were talking about back surgeries before this. I can't believe.
[ 0:00:44.000 ---> 0:00:48.000 ] Speaker B : Let me wake up here. I need to do the whole kogan thing real quick. Okay.
[ 0:00:49.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker C : Well, you know something, joe rogan, when I walked into this place, that was the perfect style for me, dude. The paintings, the mugshots, all the people that I beat up. I knew this was a place to be, man. So what you gonna do when rogan and hogan run wild on you, brother?
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:06.000 ] Speaker A : It's a good question.
[ 0:01:06.000 ---> 0:01:08.000 ] Speaker B : Okay, I'm good now.
[ 0:01:09.000 ---> 0:01:11.000 ] Speaker D : Boner and an adult boner.
[ 0:01:12.000 ---> 0:01:13.000 ] Speaker B : I'm good now.
[ 0:01:15.000 ---> 0:01:16.000 ] Speaker A : Let's go.
[ 0:01:16.000 ---> 0:01:18.000 ] Speaker B : I'm good. The coffee is great. Thank you.
[ 0:01:18.000 ---> 0:01:19.000 ] Speaker A : My pleasure.
[ 0:01:19.000 ---> 0:01:20.000 ] Speaker B : It's great.
[ 0:01:20.000 ---> 0:01:24.000 ] Speaker A : And thanks for. You have a cannabis company now. Tell us about this.
[ 0:01:25.000 ---> 0:01:29.000 ] Speaker B : Well, I got hooked up with mike tyson, flair and all.
[ 0:01:29.000 ---> 0:01:30.000 ] Speaker A : Ah, same company.
[ 0:01:31.000 ---> 0:01:56.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Guys. And our budy chad put the whole deal together. And there's kind of like the. There's. There's an open lane. There's more room at the table for one more to eat. And it was a situation. We started talking about the cbd stuff, the energy and the sleep stuff and the whole nicotine thing. And there's a way to wind backwards from all the crazy, crazy bad stuff that a lot of us have participated in over the years.
[ 0:01:56.000 ---> 0:01:57.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:01:57.000 ---> 0:02:29.000 ] Speaker B : And so it just made sense to move in that direction. And my brand has been around for so long, there's a lot of people that we really think we can help out with this stuff. So that's why we're going down that road. Because a lot of my boys, from the pharmaceutical side of things made a lot of missteps and aren't around today where I think this could have been a situation that might have helped them wind down from that crazy high they were on, from the crowds and the lifestyle and everything, to be able to settle back and become who they really are.
[ 0:02:29.000 ---> 0:02:31.000 ] Speaker A : Also pain management.
[ 0:02:32.000 ---> 0:02:56.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. That's a whole nother trip, brother, because I've had 25 surgeries in the last ten years. So when people say, hey, the wrestling is fake, it goes right up my ass, because at the end of the day, it's predetermined. If you're an ir wrestling, that's going to tell us who's going to win or lose. But all that stuff that happens in the middle, it hurts. It's a rough way to go.
[ 0:02:57.000 ---> 0:03:05.000 ] Speaker A : Well, I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I think you guys have literally the hardest job in all show business because you're out there on the road. How many days a year in your prime?
[ 0:03:06.000 ---> 0:03:16.000 ] Speaker B : Well, we were talking earlier when I was doing this full time, before the john cena and the rocket and these guys came around, I was really flying 300 days a year.
[ 0:03:16.000 ---> 0:03:17.000 ] Speaker A : 300 days.
[ 0:03:17.000 ---> 0:03:39.000 ] Speaker B : And I was wrestling 400 to 450 times a year. Jeez. I would wrestle twice. Wednesday, like a saturday morning, I'd sell out the philadelphia spectrum at 01:00 and then that night be in madison square garden, then sunday in one, in the afternoon, I'd be in the boston garden, and then sunday night, I'd be at know. So it was a pretty good stretch.
[ 0:03:39.000 ---> 0:03:50.000 ] Speaker A : That's an insane amount of work and insane amount of punishment on your body, especially knowing what you did and the way you would fucking drop down. How many of those impacts.
[ 0:03:50.000 ---> 0:03:51.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, my god.
[ 0:03:51.000 ---> 0:03:53.000 ] Speaker A : That you've experienced?
[ 0:03:53.000 ---> 0:04:45.000 ] Speaker B : Thousands. Thousands. I mean, now when I see it, the guys are younger, faster, smaller athletes, but they're super athletes. And the equipment, the rings they have, oh, my god, it's like they're perfectly made. Where I'd go wrestle andre the giant in, let's say, baltimore civic center, instead of the normal 18 foot ring, it would be a 22 foot boxing ring. It would be harder than the concrete, and andre would go, don't go down. Which means if you fall down, you're not going to get back up. So we'd actually have a match on our feet because andre was like the boss. He was the know, and he was my, you know, the equipment's so much better now. A lot of the guys getting hurt today are getting hurt because of how athletic and the crazy stuff they're doing, but we were just getting hurt from just pounding on each other so much.
[ 0:04:45.000 ---> 0:05:07.000 ] Speaker A : I remember watching brock lesnar do a front flip and land on his head, and I'm like, any other human is paralyzed from that. Any other human to be 300 plus pounds, to be built like a fucking superhero, and to do a front flip and land on your fucking head. Most people are dead.
[ 0:05:07.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker D : I think it was a backflip. I think it was a moonsault, right?
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:10.000 ] Speaker C : Was it?
[ 0:05:11.000 ---> 0:05:11.000 ] Speaker A : You would know more.
[ 0:05:11.000 ---> 0:05:15.000 ] Speaker B : It was like an inverted. He stood forward looking at you. It was like an inverted.
[ 0:05:15.000 ---> 0:05:17.000 ] Speaker A : So it was forward. There it is, tony.
[ 0:05:17.000 ---> 0:05:18.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, it is forward.
[ 0:05:18.000 ---> 0:05:19.000 ] Speaker B : Look at the fuck.
[ 0:05:20.000 ---> 0:05:22.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, it was a forward backflip, and.
[ 0:05:22.000 ---> 0:05:24.000 ] Speaker A : He landed on his own head.
[ 0:05:24.000 ---> 0:05:25.000 ] Speaker D : Oh, my god.
[ 0:05:25.000 ---> 0:05:27.000 ] Speaker A : Dude, that's insane. Most people are dead.
[ 0:05:27.000 ---> 0:05:30.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, most people are mean.
[ 0:05:30.000 ---> 0:05:38.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know what permanent damage he suffered, but by the way, he went from that to fight in the ufc. Yeah, he fought in the ufc after that, which is insane.
[ 0:05:38.000 ---> 0:07:07.000 ] Speaker B : Well, I got him first when he came back from the ufc. Okay. And I was kind of, like, winding down, putting guys over and doing my thing, and vince goes, I want you to work with brock. I went, okay. Well, I knew his budy, brad riggins, who lived in minnesota. He was the coach of the olympic team several years back. And so when brock was in high school, we had heard of him. We kept an eye on him. But when he came back from ufc, they gave him to me first. And he was really intense, brother. He was really intense. So my whole thing is, we always grab somebody and squeeze them and give them the office. Like, we got my head, and you're about to break my neck. Give him the office. So you lighten up. I squeezed the piss out of him, giving him the office, and finally I just started calling him broccoli. I said, broccoli? I got him to laugh a little bit. I said, let me tell you something. If you keep hurting me in here, if you don't loosen up on the old man here, I'm going to make you look really bad, because you can be in here by yourself. I used to tease him all the time because he's a really good friend. And so when I got him first, he was really intense, and now he's like. He turned out to be one of the best workers this business has ever seen. Yeah, I mean, he. Brother, he draws money, he backpedals, he sells. He's got instinct, he's got placement. He knows where he's at. He listens. You don't have to tell him what to do. You don't have to have a writer write the match out. He goes out and listens to the crowd with his mind and his heart, and it's something that's a lost art form. He's got it, man. So he figured it out.
[ 0:07:07.000 ---> 0:07:17.000 ] Speaker A : That's interesting that it's like a lost art form, because for people who don't know how you guys do a match. There's a lot of improvisation going on.
[ 0:07:17.000 ---> 0:07:53.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. If you're really good at what you do, you're in the back, and all of a sudden, if you're really good at what you do back in the day, I'm talking old school stuff. The referee would come to you and say, hey, hogan, they want you to go over piper with a leg drop. Or they want a count out or know. So knowing know. Piper was so good at what he did, or mr. Wonderful. A lot of guys I worked be. If we were in the same dressing room, we wouldn't even talk. I'll see you out there, brother. You're going overnight. Okay, I'm going over. It was that know, and the crowd will tell you what to do if you listen.
