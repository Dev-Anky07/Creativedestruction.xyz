- Offchain Labs is the team that's been developing the Arbitram technology stack. Why would you build on Arbitram? It can help solve the blockchain trilemma by having scale. Using Arbitram is extremely simple.
- There's about $6 billion in total value bridged from Ethereum. There's more than 10 million wallets and over 1000 applications that have launched the Arbitram stack. Arbitram enabled a whole new class of builders that could not have existed on layer One. There has absolutely been no drop within the ecosystem.
- The Norwegian government is working on two different things on the Arbitram Tech stack. The first is the building of a private registry. The second is the testing of a CBDC. As we continue to scale, I think it's critical that additional parties can obviously take advantage of the technology stack.
- Arbitram Nova is a really great focus on arbitram One and DeFi. It's really meant for high throughput DApps that are consumer scaling focused and also gaming. We've seen a ton of new games being committed to the Arbitram ecosystem.
- There's a lot of demand these days for application specific chains. Arbitrum Orbit allows you to get exposure to components of the technology stack that the Dao has not adopted. It gives you a lot more flexibility than you can have on a public chain. Getting more developers and users to use these applications should still remain the top priority.
- One growing use case that we're seeing now a lot more demand is around permissioned access. On a public chain, there are a couple of downsides cross chain friction. Building within the Arbitram ecosystem is truly an honor every day.
