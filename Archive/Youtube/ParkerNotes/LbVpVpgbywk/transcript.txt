[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:08.000 ] Speaker A : I love books. I really, really love books. But I've got a problem.
[ 0:00:08.000 ---> 0:00:22.000 ] Speaker B : There are so many books that I want to read just vying for my attention. And there are so many other things that deserve my attention. Not to mention those things that don't deserve my attention, but steal it anyways.
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:26.000 ] Speaker A : You so I've learned that if I.
[ 0:00:26.000 ---> 0:01:04.000 ] Speaker B : Want to be a reader and I want to make progress on all these different books, I need to set reading goals and I need to track those goals every single day. Welcome to Park Notes. I'm Parker Seticase. I'm a philosopher here to help you study and think more deeply. In this video, I'm going to introduce you to the very best tool for developing a daily reading habit. To some of you, it's going to be very basic and obvious. To to others, it may be life changing like it was for me, the tool is very simple. It's just a reading log or a daily page number log. But there's a couple of things you need to know in order to use this properly. So make sure you watch to the end so you can become an expert in using a daily reading log. Let's jump right in.
[ 0:01:04.000 ---> 0:01:05.000 ] Speaker C : So today there are a lot of.
[ 0:01:05.000 ---> 0:01:08.000 ] Speaker B : Different methods and tips and tricks for reading more.
[ 0:01:08.000 ---> 0:01:10.000 ] Speaker C : But I found the daily reading log.
[ 0:01:10.000 ---> 0:04:32.000 ] Speaker B : To be the best. I used to hate reading. I used to fall asleep on my homework assignments. I'd wake up drooling in my books until I discovered the daily reading log or the daily page number log. I didn't find this on YouTube or read it in any book. I just kind of did it myself and then came to find out. This is a common thing that people use for studying. This tool is universal. If you're good at reading, you can use this. If you're bad at reading, you can also use this. It's just a way for you to set a reading goal and then track it every single day. So before we go into the details on the reading log as a tool, we need to up with our daily reading goal. There are two broad approaches to coming up with your daily reading goal. A top down approach and a bottom up approach. I used to use this top down approach and I actually don't like it. But let me give you two ways you can use a top down approach for coming up with your daily page number goal. Maybe you say, hey, I want to read 52 books this year. That's one book a week. So you go and you plan out every single book that you're going to read for every single week. You look up the page numbers for each individual book that you're going to read, and you divide that by seven so that you can stay on track every day to finish reading that book in that week. Now, that's a lot of work and you have to have a lot of foresight to say, I'm going to read this book. I'm going to want to read this book in three months. When it comes to that, I have a harder time. My interest wax and wane. I'm not sure that I like that method that much. But the second top down method would be to say I want to average 52 books a year, and so I can look up the average number of pages in the average book. I can multiply that by 52, one for each week, and then I can divide that number by 365 to come up with the average amount of pages I should read every single day. Now that's a decent method. I've used this as well. I like this one better than actually mapping out every individual book that I want to read for a year. But at the end of the day, the goal of reading 52 books in a year is a little bit arbitrary. One a week. I guess that's kind of cool. But what happens the next year? Are you going to do that every single year? What matters more than accomplishing this certain task of reading 52 books in a year is that you become a reader that you read every day, that you embrace this lifestyle of continued learning. So I actually like a bottom up approach. This one's much easier. You say, how many pages do I think that I can read in a single day? If you read one page a day, you're going to read 365 pages in a year. That's at least one book. Now double that. Now you have two books. Now triple that. Quadruple that. Keep going on and on and you can average out, hey, I will probably get this many books a year, but that's actually not as important as you continually reading every single day. If you develop a daily habit of reading, the book pile will grow. You'll look back and say, wow, I can't believe how many books I actually read this year. So don't limit yourself. Maybe you'll read way more than 52 books if you read 75 pages a day. But depending on the genre that you read, you'll be able to read more or less books that doesn't matter as much. Set a daily page number goal that is reasonable for you to achieve, but is also going to challenge you. It's just like lifting weights. Progressive overload. You can read more and more as you continue to read. As you continue to stretch your reading muscles and expand your mind so you can come up with your daily page number goal by using one of the two top down methods. If you have a different method that's top down, let me know. I'd love to it leave me a comment, but I like the bottom up method. It's reasonable for me, but it's still going to be a challenge. It's still going to stretch me and make me grow. You can change your daily goal if it's too easy or if it's too hard, but come up with a daily goal. Then multiply that daily goal by 365 and that will be your yearly goal. You can divide that yearly goal number by 300, which is like the average book, and you can get a rough estimate for how many books you will.
[ 0:04:32.000 ---> 0:04:33.000 ] Speaker A : Read in a given year.
[ 0:04:33.000 ---> 0:04:34.000 ] Speaker C : So let's say you either use a.
[ 0:04:34.000 ---> 0:04:51.000 ] Speaker B : Top down or bottom up approach to coming up with a daily page number goal. Now you're going to write that goal in the front of your reading log. I like to use a physical notebook. This is where I'm going to capture and log all the pages that I actually read for a given day. So let me show you how I use my daily reading log.
[ 0:04:51.000 ---> 0:04:58.000 ] Speaker C : So my method for tracking daily page number goals has been the same since November 30, 2015.
[ 0:04:58.000 ---> 0:05:00.000 ] Speaker A : I know that because I keep good records here.
[ 0:05:00.000 ---> 0:05:08.000 ] Speaker C : It's pretty simple, it's pretty basic, and anyone can do it with any kind of journal. I like these line ones. You can go square, you can go dotted, whatever. But I like the line ones.
[ 0:05:08.000 ---> 0:05:09.000 ] Speaker A : I like just wRiting.
[ 0:05:09.000 ---> 0:05:30.000 ] Speaker C : This is history of Western philosophy and theology. I abbreviate it because I'm not writing out that whole thing. So I write down the book. I write down the page numbers I started at and where I finished. Then I will block out the number of pages. I'll do that for each book I read that day. Some of you may just be reading one book, that's fine. I like to read multiple books at once. I will add those up and then I'll circle the total for the day.
[ 0:05:30.000 ---> 0:05:32.000 ] Speaker A : So you see a lot of circles on here.
[ 0:05:36.000 ---> 0:05:39.000 ] Speaker C : Circling the total for the day allows me to go back when I'm tallying.
[ 0:05:39.000 ---> 0:05:44.000 ] Speaker A : Up my monthly page numbers to just look at one number per day and.
[ 0:05:45.000 ---> 0:05:46.000 ] Speaker C : Then I can add them all up.
[ 0:05:46.000 ---> 0:05:48.000 ] Speaker A : At the end of the month and.
[ 0:05:48.000 ---> 0:05:51.000 ] Speaker C : I'll highlight that number so that when I'm looking back in December, I only.
[ 0:05:51.000 ---> 0:05:54.000 ] Speaker A : Need to find twelve numbers to add up.
[ 0:05:55.000 ---> 0:06:00.000 ] Speaker C : So for instance, here's 2017. There's the total for December.
[ 0:06:00.000 ---> 0:06:01.000 ] Speaker A : Then I added up all the page.
[ 0:06:02.000 ---> 0:06:08.000 ] Speaker C : Numbers from each month, and I got 13,739 pages for 2017.
[ 0:06:08.000 ---> 0:06:09.000 ] Speaker A : Can't remember if that was my goal.
[ 0:06:09.000 ---> 0:06:10.000 ] Speaker C : Or not, but I do have the.
[ 0:06:10.000 ---> 0:06:11.000 ] Speaker A : Goal in here somewhere.
[ 0:06:11.000 ---> 0:06:14.000 ] Speaker C : So here's my first one, going all the way back to 2015.
[ 0:06:15.000 ---> 0:06:17.000 ] Speaker A : Here's my second one. Same method.
[ 0:06:17.000 ---> 0:06:18.000 ] Speaker C : You can see all the way through.
[ 0:06:18.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker A : There's 2018, 2019.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:23.000 ] Speaker C : Same exact method. I love doing this.
[ 0:06:23.000 ---> 0:06:26.000 ] Speaker A : It's really helpful for me. So again, it's super simple.
[ 0:06:26.000 ---> 0:06:28.000 ] Speaker C : You just write down the title of the book.
[ 0:06:28.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker A : You write down the page you started at.
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:31.000 ] Speaker C : Then when you're done with that session.
[ 0:06:32.000 ---> 0:06:33.000 ] Speaker A : You write down the page you ended at.
[ 0:06:33.000 ---> 0:06:36.000 ] Speaker C : Maybe you get back into that book twice that day.
[ 0:06:36.000 ---> 0:06:38.000 ] Speaker A : Just start another entry and then block.
[ 0:06:39.000 ---> 0:06:40.000 ] Speaker C : Off the number of pages.
[ 0:06:40.000 ---> 0:06:46.000 ] Speaker A : You got to add them all up at the end of the day and circle that. Then when you're done with the month.
[ 0:06:47.000 ---> 0:06:52.000 ] Speaker C : Tally them all up and circle that. I like to highlight it so that when I'm looking back for my yearly.
[ 0:06:52.000 ---> 0:06:52.000 ] Speaker A : Goals.
[ 0:06:54.000 ---> 0:06:59.000 ] Speaker C : All I need to look for is twelve numbers. Here's the current one I'm working with.
[ 0:06:59.000 ---> 0:07:14.000 ] Speaker A : I have a saddleback leather. Surprise, surprise. This is a really old version of the Moleskin cover. I have a hardback moleskin medium moleskin in my Saddleback reading log.
[ 0:07:15.000 ---> 0:07:17.000 ] Speaker C : Floss Raptor, of course.
[ 0:07:17.000 ---> 0:07:18.000 ] Speaker A : Let me see.
[ 0:07:18.000 ---> 0:07:23.000 ] Speaker C : Floss Raptor other places. So I have my floss Raptor sticker.
[ 0:07:23.000 ---> 0:07:27.000 ] Speaker A : That reminds me to be a good floss Raptor. But same method here.
[ 0:07:27.000 ---> 0:07:34.000 ] Speaker C : Going all the way to 2020 and all the way to the present. I love doing it this way. If you guys have a better one again, let me know in the comments.
[ 0:07:35.000 ---> 0:07:38.000 ] Speaker A : I want to hear from you. But I've used this to help me.
[ 0:07:38.000 ---> 0:08:00.000 ] Speaker C : Keep on track with my own goals. To help me become a reader, to become someone who just reads. This is part of my life. I have goals. I have ways of capturing those goals. And I have reminders outside in the world, not in the digital world, that remind me, oh yeah, I need to be reading. Oh yeah, I have daily goals to be hitting. Oh yeah, I need to mark down those goals. So let's run a test case here. We'll use this one since I have.
[ 0:08:00.000 ---> 0:08:02.000 ] Speaker A : Some space at the end that's empty.
[ 0:08:02.000 ---> 0:08:05.000 ] Speaker C : So let's say that I'm reading Dune again.
[ 0:08:05.000 ---> 0:08:14.000 ] Speaker A : I'm going to start by writing the date and then the title of the book. If it's a new book, then I'll.
[ 0:08:14.000 ---> 0:08:16.000 ] Speaker C : Write the author's name, too, just so.
[ 0:08:16.000 ---> 0:08:19.000 ] Speaker A : I know so there's Dune. That's by Herbert.
[ 0:08:19.000 ---> 0:08:20.000 ] Speaker C : I should know what that is.
[ 0:08:20.000 ---> 0:08:22.000 ] Speaker A : Later on, I might just put Dune.
[ 0:08:22.000 ---> 0:08:24.000 ] Speaker B : I'm going to just put Dune because.
[ 0:08:24.000 ---> 0:08:27.000 ] Speaker C : I don't need to keep writing Herbert. I'll be able to see from context.
[ 0:08:27.000 ---> 0:08:28.000 ] Speaker A : What book it is.
[ 0:08:28.000 ---> 0:08:32.000 ] Speaker C : And let's say that we started at page 335.
[ 0:08:32.000 ---> 0:08:37.000 ] Speaker A : So I'm going to start by writing just page 335.
[ 0:08:37.000 ---> 0:08:38.000 ] Speaker C : And I'll put a dash so I.
[ 0:08:38.000 ---> 0:08:39.000 ] Speaker A : Know that I'm starting there.
[ 0:08:39.000 ---> 0:08:48.000 ] Speaker C : I'm going through, and that's an uncompleted loop. I need to come back to that. I need to enter in that data for when I'm done reading. Let's say that I was a beast.
[ 0:08:48.000 ---> 0:08:54.000 ] Speaker A : And I got to like three eightyn. Boom.
[ 0:08:54.000 ---> 0:08:55.000 ] Speaker C : So that's still not complete.
[ 0:08:55.000 ---> 0:09:00.000 ] Speaker A : I need to do the math and figure out what's the number there. Shoot.
[ 0:09:00.000 ---> 0:09:03.000 ] Speaker C : Now I got to figure out the math. I think that's 54 pages.
[ 0:09:03.000 ---> 0:09:05.000 ] Speaker A : Then I'm going to bracket that out.
[ 0:09:05.000 ---> 0:09:10.000 ] Speaker C : So that's the completed for this book. During this session. If I went back and read again.
[ 0:09:11.000 ---> 0:09:16.000 ] Speaker A : Later in the day, maybe I'll do just the same so I don't need.
[ 0:09:16.000 ---> 0:09:18.000 ] Speaker C : To write it down again. And this time I went from page.
[ 0:09:18.000 ---> 0:09:26.000 ] Speaker A : 383, 99, so the math is easier. Now it's ten pages. Boom.
[ 0:09:26.000 ---> 0:09:31.000 ] Speaker C : Let's say I then went and read Pascal's ponce. And let's say that we started at.
[ 0:09:31.000 ---> 0:09:42.000 ] Speaker A : Page ten and went through 25. There's 15 pages. Sometimes they'll write pages.
[ 0:09:42.000 ---> 0:09:45.000 ] Speaker C : I think I like writing pages better than just the number that's to each his own.
[ 0:09:45.000 ---> 0:09:54.000 ] Speaker A : Then we just total these up. There's 64, 74, 79. This was a good day. Now when I'm going back through, all.
[ 0:09:54.000 ---> 0:09:57.000 ] Speaker C : I need to look for is the 79 pages.
[ 0:10:00.000 ---> 0:10:01.000 ] Speaker A : And it's simple as that.
[ 0:10:01.000 ---> 0:10:05.000 ] Speaker C : So, naturally, being a book guy, people always ask me, what about Goodreads?
[ 0:10:05.000 ---> 0:10:11.000 ] Speaker A : What about Goodreads? I don't really like Goodreads all that much. I'm not good at it.
[ 0:10:11.000 ---> 0:10:15.000 ] Speaker C : I'm not good at keeping track and finding all the books. It's just so much easier for me.
[ 0:10:15.000 ---> 0:10:18.000 ] Speaker A : To write it down. I know some people love Goodreads.
[ 0:10:18.000 ---> 0:10:19.000 ] Speaker C : They swear by it. They want to see other people.
[ 0:10:19.000 ---> 0:10:20.000 ] Speaker A : That's cool.
[ 0:10:20.000 ---> 0:10:21.000 ] Speaker B : If you guys like Goodreads, then go.
[ 0:10:21.000 ---> 0:10:39.000 ] Speaker C : Ahead and do Goodreads. I like having the physical copy. I really, really like seeing it. I like it not being in my smartphone where there's all these other icons and stuff which are supposed to draw my attention away from what I want to be doing. So for me, having it in the digital space is not great, but I have this. I can put it on my nightstand.
[ 0:10:39.000 ---> 0:10:43.000 ] Speaker A : I can put it on my desk on my table where I see.
[ 0:10:43.000 ---> 0:10:45.000 ] Speaker C : Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be reading. Oh yeah, I have daily goals.
[ 0:10:45.000 ---> 0:10:47.000 ] Speaker A : Oh yeah, I need to close the.
[ 0:10:47.000 ---> 0:11:18.000 ] Speaker C : Loop on that and write down how many goals I got last night or yesterday as if I forgot. So here it is. It's a good reminder. And when I look at this, I'm reminded of books. I'm reminded of my reading goals. I'm not reminded to check Facebook, to check Instagram. I'm not reminded of all my emails. So I may get better at doing good reads just for the community aspect. But for now, I really, really like an analog model. I'm showing myself that I take it really, really seriously, so seriously that I have its own book. I like to wrap it in leather. A lot of people aren't going to go for that. That's fine, you don't have to.
[ 0:11:18.000 ---> 0:11:28.000 ] Speaker A : I'm not trying to hawk saddle deck though. If you guys want to partner up, hit me up because I will promote your stuff anywAys. That's neither here nor there.
[ 0:11:29.000 ---> 0:11:32.000 ] Speaker C : I am not a huge Goodreads guy. Sorry.
[ 0:11:32.000 ---> 0:12:18.000 ] Speaker B : Okay, so let's sum it all back up. If you want to become a reader and develop a daily habit of reading, then you should use a daily reading log. In order to use this properly, you need to come up with a goal. You can do this top down by saying I want to read X number of books in a given year and then dividing that down. Or you can build it bottom up, building up to your year goal. I know it seems pretty simple. That's because it is. And I think that's the beauty of this method. If you guys like this video, make sure to leave me a like and drop a comment. I want to hear from you guys. Have you used this method before? Do you think you'll start using this method or do you have a better method for capturing your daily page number goals? If you currently have a daily page number goal, what is it? I want to hear from you guys. How many pages are you reading every day? Or at least trying to read every day? Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any future videos on study habits. I'll see you guys next time.
