- David's Takes is a semi regular segment on Bankless. I write an article for the Bankless newsletter and I read it to you here. This take is everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint. I just returned from my fifth and last conference tour of 2024.
- For the first time ever, I went to a non Ethereum conference. My only perceptions of Salana is through Twitter, which is a terrible lens for viewing anything these days. Here is everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint.

- Solana has attracted a community of engineers that Ethereum was not able to nerdsnipe. The pragmatists of crypto likely find a cozy home in the space between hardware and software. In reality, the Solana community is just another crypto community.
- This is the third Salana breakpoint to occur. First time that Breakpoint has been hosted after the excitement from the bull market is gone. This vibe naturally brought in a sense of optimism and excitement for the future. The narrative around Solana has found new meaning.
- Salana's Token 22 package software package nothing to do with Token 2049. Package brings a ton of additional functionalities to Salana tokens, including custom permissions and confidential transactions. For further rabbit holes on what makes the Solana community excited, listen to the second half of this conversation.
- Is bankless finally bullish on Solana? Solana has certainly captured more of my attention lately. It was disheartening to see a fully packed room during a panel about governance. I will let the future decide.
