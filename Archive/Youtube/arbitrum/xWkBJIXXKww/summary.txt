- It's not every day that a chain launches a token. And today, that day has arrived for Arbitram. Arbitrum goes from a project by the Arbitrum team to a project owned and operated by the community.
- How long did you guys know that today would be the day? People are super excited internally. And I am personally super proud to be a part of this team. The polish and the amount of material and thoughtfulness that went into the governance, the criteria for the AirDrop.
- The ability for people to launch their own L three chains on top of Arbitram One and Arbitram Nova is extremely exciting from developer perspective. I think we'll see massive amounts of innovation on the app level and the DAP level that we see today, but also on the chain level.
- Arbitram is perhaps the first roll up chain to reach phase one. Stage two will be what you would think of as a really full roll up. The two big parts of stage one are working fraud or validity proof. And then the other main criteria is to even further weaken the powers of the Security Council.
- 12 point 75% of the token supply will be given out next Thursday on March 23. There's the user AirDrop broadly and the Dow AirDrop. In order to be eligible for this, you had to use Arbitrum in a meaningful way anytime.
- And I just want to go back to the idea of airdropping tokens to Arbitram DAOs. This is, in my mind, an interpretation of decentralization. It's punted on some responsibility of distributing the token and allowing the DAOs to decide amongst themselves. We hope that to set a precedent with this, that others will do that going forward.
- 44% went to insiders, by insiders here, the team and future team advisors and also investors, and 56% to the community. Team and investors are subject to four year lockups. Team instructed not to directly vote with their tokens. Instead they are encouraged to delegate to community members.
- There's a seven day period where the token is not claimable. The most successful way to encourage people to delegate their tokens is to have that as part of the token claiming process. We have a live stream on Bankless with you all later today at 04:00 p. m. Eastern.
- How are we going to decentralize the validation of the Arbitrum chains and also the Security Council? There are some complicated technical issues around making validation fully permissionless. There are a lot of promising ideas floating around the ecosystem for really getting to that kind of final point.
- There is a constitution of the arbitrary Dao that lays out the procedures and that constitution can be amended by the Dao members. I'm wondering if there's any talk about like a two house token model or any how would, if governance wanted to change governance structure into something different.
- The last topic of conversation is this brand new thing called Arbitrum Orbit. Who wants to guide us through this conversation? Where does this really start?
- Changes to the licensing scheme allows for anybody to use the Arbitrum Nitro code base to run layer three chains of any kind. This opens up this amazing spectrum of possibilities. The amount of innovation this will allow for to me is mind boggling.
- Anyone can go ahead and build an L Three chain. The first one that I know of, I don't know open and it's there. A gaming project that a successful gaming project from a different ecosystem that plans to build their own Arbitrum layer three chain and that I think will be announced.
- Here we are in 2023 with the launch of a decentralized Arbitram technology. Take us all the way back to the earliest days of Arbitrum and remind us how long of a journey it's been.
- A big congratulations to all of the Arbitrum founders, co founders, team members, and everyone who's helped create this day. Right now that Arbitrum is emerging from its awkward adolescence and is becoming a grown up system, it has a lot of exciting times ahead of it.
- A last opportunity to give a call to action. What do people listening right now need to go do? Where do they need to find out more? And what should they do now that this day has arrived?
