- Ancient Egypt was amongst the first major human civilizations in existence. The pyramids were constructed about 500 years, years after the nation took shape. The fall of ancient Egypt happened closer to the construction of the Burj Khalifa than it did to the building of the pyramids. The vast timeline is part of what makes Egypt, and its economy, so fascinating.
- Economy of ancient Egypt represents an economy in its most basic form. No frills and nuance, just an economy desperately trying to harvest and allocate resources to satisfy the central economic problem. There are only so many resources available in the world.
- The Egyptians had a centrally planned economy for the big picture stuff with a pinch of personal liberty for smaller scale consumption. There was a strict hierarchy of society with a foundation in farm labor and a pinnacle with absolute power residing in the pharaoh. This structure was actually a pretty robust blend of absolute control and personal liberty.
- The economy of ancient Egypt was of course not nearly as complex as the economies of the modern day. But the lessons learned over their 3000 years or so are no less relevant. Technology, industries, hyper, advanced financial systems, they have all changed. But people, people will always be the same.
