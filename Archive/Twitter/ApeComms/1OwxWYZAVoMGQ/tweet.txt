- Hello, everybody. We are here to talk about Coin Dow's Ape chain. Anybody that would like to be part of the discussion or have questions, go ahead and request Lumberg. Let me know if I've missed anybody here.
- Ape chain will be launching with more than just a proxy to a siG. There are a lot of costs associated with launching a layer two. With blast, my hopes are high and I feel we're going to do well again with the AC token.
- If you go the AC token route, would you even need an AIP from the Dow. Alternatively, this brings up the whole RFP thing. How are we going to put together a team to even field an RFP?
- The actual design for the token is not finalized, and I think it's best if it is an ongoing discussion. The priority is to ensure that we have efficient use of the sequencer. The real job is to create a vibrant chain with a lot of usage.
- If an AC token exists, it should be used to make sure that those sequencer fees are being. collected. I don't think the AC token will be something that replaces ape, but rather works in coordination with ape. This is more about making sure that there's projects and activity behind the chain.
- The topic here on Ape chain. It's closing. The discussion is closing in two days. Do feel free to drop any more thoughts or questions there on the discourse forum. And then perhaps we'll do another space to address any outstanding questions before post the official AIP proposal.
