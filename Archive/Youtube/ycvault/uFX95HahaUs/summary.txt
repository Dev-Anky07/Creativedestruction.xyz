- What makes you guys decide to invest in a founder or a company? Either of you first. Mark can start while we try to get your slide up. Bringing an AP guy.
- SV Angel and its entities have invested in over 700 companies. What makes us invest in a company is based on a whole bunch of characteristics. First question is what inspired you to invent this product? Then I'm looking for communication skills. There's a lot of detail to this question.
- The venture capital business is 100% a game of outliers. The other thing I'd highlight that we think about a lot internally is we have this concept invest in strength versus lack of weakness. The companies that have the really extreme strengths often have serious flaws.
- When you first meet an investor, you've got to be able to say in one compelling sentence what your product does. Once you have a great product, then it's all about execution and building a great team. The only way to make progress is make decisions.
- Parker: Most of the stuff with my current company felt like from a fundraising perspective, felt like it came together relatively quickly. The other point I want to make is bootstrap as long as you possibly can. Never forget the bootstrap.
- Raising venture capital is the easiest thing a startup founder is ever going to do. Almost everything you'll ever do is harder than raising venture capital. You're almost always better off making your business better than you are making your pitch better.
- Mark Zuckerberg: The single biggest thing entrepreneurs are missing is the relationship between risk and cash. He says running a startup is a process of peeling away layers of risk as you go. Zuckerberg: My advice on fundraising is not getting things in writing.
- SV angel invests in seed stage startups. We end up investing in one company for every 30 that we look at. SV angel has now a staff of 13 people. If enough of the team at SV thinks it's interesting, then they appoint a person to make a phone call to that founder.
- Top tier venture capitalists only invest in companies that have previously raised a seed round. It's almost always the case when we're doing a Series A investment that the company has a million or $2 million in seed financing. The best way to get the best introductions to the A stage venture firms is through the seed investors.
- Most important thing at the seed stage is picking the right seed investors. They're going to make the right introductions. There's an enormous difference in the quality of an introduction. What terms should founders care most about and how should founders negotiate?
- How do you figure out what the right valuation for a company is? What other terms? I probably started a little too high on the valuation side, as you guys know. Whether you raise it twelve or nine or like, six, it's not a huge deal for the rest of the company.
- Is there a maximum amount of the company you think founders should sell in their seed round and a round beyond which problems happen? It seems like ten to 15% is what people say, but that's mostly just what I've heard.
- Mark: What's the most successful investment you've ever made? Ron: Clearly it was the investment in Google in 1999, and we got Google return out of it. He met Google through a Stanford professor who was an angel investor in Google.
- We did the first big growth round in Airbnb at about a billion dollar valuation in 2011. I believe that will turn out to be one of the spectacular growth investments of all time. Why do you think Airbnb is such a great company? All three founders are as good as the other founder.
- Does raising money help you with an exit or an acquire? Well, if you pick good investors who have good rolodexes and domain expertise in what your company does, they're going to add a lot more value than the money. But that shouldn't enter into the decision making process too much.
- The more capital intensive the business, the more intense and serious you have to be about exactly what's going to be required to make the business work. You have to raise as close to the exact right amount of money as possible. Operational excellence on the part of the team matters a lot more.
- The choice of key investors is just as important as who you get married to. It really is like getting married, and it is worth spending significant time really understanding who you're about. Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur. We're investing for life.
- SV Angels kind of gotten comfortable with one a week. And that's a staff of 13. So it's really the number of companies. I would rather just add value, more value to the existing companies.
- SB Angel has a written conflict policy, but most when we end up with a conflict, it's usually because one company has morphed into another space. With SB Angel, the relationship between the founder and us is based on trust. If somebody doesn't trust us, then they shouldn't work with us.
- The big constraint on a top tier venture capital firm is the concept of opportunity cost. Every investment we make, number one, rules out conflicts. The other issue is opportunity cost on the time and bandwidth of the general partners.
- Most of the power that VCs have comes outside of the board structure. If things are going well at the company, you have unlimited power, visa vis your investors, almost unlimited. When a company gets in dire straits, they all get renegotiated.
