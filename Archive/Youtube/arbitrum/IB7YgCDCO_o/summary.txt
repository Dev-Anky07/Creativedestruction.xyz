- For today's AMA, we have Nifty Kit, pretty much a very classic OG team if you're familiar with the NFT space. Dan is the CEO of Niftykit and Terrence is the CTO. They'll talk about their recent integration of Arbitrum and a couple of other interesting and fun things.
- Nifty Kit is a no code smart contract platform focused on building tools for creators and artists so they can easily launch their NFT drops. This year alone, we've done over 21 million in creator revenue just through our self serve platform.
- At Niftykit, we believe NFTs can be for anybody, not just artists and developers or people that are running projects. The kind of experiences that we're going to be able to unlock in the future is just going to blow our minds. One of the things we're constantly trying to get feedback on and learn, is just how creators are using the different chains.
- The way that Nifty Kit makes money is we have an NFT membership. Each pass has a different sales percentage for the primary sale that we take. One thing that we're excited to do is offer a community pass to the entire Arbitram community.
- Nifty Kit allows artists to create their own NFT Smart Contracts. Many artists do not have any sort of technical background. Getting into crypto really is not easy, especially in 2023. The future that we see is all artists on board.
- Niftykit is trying out the NFT Pass membership. Once you deploy your smart contract, you don't technically have to pay us to use it. We want to see all of you I see are minting the past. It's a great way to learn.
- Can you give us an idea of some of the successful and or unique projects that have launched using Nifty kit. These smaller, unique projects are really interesting because with NFTs, it's not like you need to have a crazy amount of following to execute whatever you're trying to do.
- The future of NFTs in our opinion is still we're still kind of shaping it. Ultimately, it's a community and experience building tool and we're yet to see all the really cool use cases that come out of it. The opportunities that the L Two specifically something that I'm personally excited about is just what's going to be built later on.
- Hunter: What does the roadmap for Nifty Kit look like? Next couple of months the very least. One of the new contracts that we're working on is having the ability to launch your own marketplace contracts. Please follow us on Twitter, join our discord if you have any questions.
