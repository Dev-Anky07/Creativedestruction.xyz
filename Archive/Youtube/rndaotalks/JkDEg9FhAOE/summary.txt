- R Dao talks aim to share knowledge, bring people together and spark conversations. Francesca will give a presentation, and then at the end of that, we'll open it up for questions. We want this to be a multilateral discussion, not just a Q and A.
- I've pretty much been working in this field of, let's say, new ways of organizing for about ten years. I'm a person who isn't really that much into theory, I got to say. Part of the reason I do the work that I do now is to really help all of the different networks, communities, organizations out there that are trying to do new ways for organizing.
- The topic of this session is the leadership myths and misconceptions. I want to share four myths with you and give a bit of a context around what those are and how they show up. Here we go.
- Leading means taking control, right? And somehow doing something to others that I'm exerting power over them obviously makes it quite scary to step into leadership. We're trying to shift from an idea of power over to power with.
- The idea that when we're doing self management there's not going to be leadership is always there. There's a real fear of anyone stepping into leadership. This not happening is really to the detriment of a lot of really great organizations.
- When we talk about equality, where we definitely want to have equality is every individual's value as a human right. But where we're not equal is when we think about the roles we might hold, the contributions we might make. And depending on the context, we're going to have different roles of power.
- Third myth being that leadership is often seen as an identity. And I think the notion that we really try to work with much more that I think makes it much more accessible to everyone is really leadership. It's about how you show up and the way you are being in a certain space.
- The fourth myth is that leadership is really visionary leadership. Alana Irving has developed a concept that articulates the diversity of different ways that leadership can manifest. She says it's important for us to acknowledge much more diversity in how leadership can look.
- So I think the last sort of idea that I just want to leave you with is really this idea of self leadership. With that starting point we have the best foundation to create thriving organizations. If anyone would like to chip in with either, a question, a comment, some of your own ideas that you'd like to bring.
- Francisca: If the organization is focused on value capture and being extractive, then it's probably well, I don't know if it's self managing. The best way for you to express your leadership is to if you're the turtle or the bunny, you express it fully.
- Lisa, what are you sensing works well for reprogramming at the individual and systemic level to shift towards self managing? I really think that embodiment is something really key in this actually working. To really develop the trust that something is different, you need to experience it.
- Michelle: The fear is that if I see a risk, I'll get voted over. This is very tied into this idea of consent, I believe, self management. It's a little off. Tell me more.
- Lisa: It happens decision by decision, experience by experience and Decision by decision. And it happens for anybody, positional leader or not. When my objection, the decision is adjusted to meet it. It's hard not to use positional power when you sense a risk.
- Daniel: We're so much operating in systems where we need to convince everyone else that what I'm sensing is valid. If you're sensing it is true, I don't necessarily need to understand it for me to respect it and take it into account. But I personally have time seeing how you're going to really thrive and be successful if you don't have more relationships between people.
- The idea of a source being a role in any kind of initiative that a person is holding. To me it seems like one of the things that a source will do is step into certain types of leadership. But that doesn't mean that the source is the leader and that there could be many, many other people leading as well.
- Daniel: I make the distinction between leadership in that sense and the role of source. The role of Source is not specifically developing people, it's manifesting vision. It really comes down to how do you best create the culture to where all the people feel safe to do that.
- Do you see more success starting at the executive level down with how you guys look to implement? We have to be able to have leaders that can be full circle. You can't do this without the leadership being on board. It's something that's happening at all levels.
