- Matt: I'm from Caldera. We're a roll ups as a service company. I'm here to talk about Arbitram orbit chains. Why you might consider building an orbit chain, the kind of motivations behind them, and how Caldera can help.
- In the beginning, there was Ethereum vitalik. But we have a major problem. Ethereum is slow. So the solution that all of us in the industry came up to was roll ups. One is the most consistent with the rest of the history. However, what if we want to build a completely different ecosystem?
- The first order thing might be performance. You get dedicated TPS effectively a dedicated lane on the highway just for your application. Certain applications, especially latency sensitive ones like gaming, might eventually see those applications shard themselves across multiple chains. Running your own chain gives you several such paths to revenue.
- Codera aims to be the easiest way for people to launch Arbitrum orbit chains. We offer reliable sequencer hosting. And as well, we offer dedicated support. Our mission is to make the app chain or the app roll up thesis more accessible.
