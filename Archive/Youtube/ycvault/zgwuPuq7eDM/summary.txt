- Next, we have a fireside chat with YC's, jared Friedman and Ivana Geretic. Ivana is the founder and founding CEO of Asherbio. Before we get started, go ahead and take a seat.
- Jared is one of the major forces behind the launching and growing of the YC bio community. In 2019, he wrote a piece on what the next ten years of startup bio fundraising would look like. What I'm really excited about today is for you all to hear the story of Asher Bio.
- Asherbio builds better immunotherapies for patients. The company is focused on activating only the correct immune cells, like those that kill cancer, without the severe side effects. We are using or developing protein engineering technologies that enable us to develop cytokines that activate only the cells that matter.
- Azure Bio is a Series B stage company. Last year, we raised $108,000,000 Series B round. We are now over 50 employees. Majority are still research and preclinical, but we're rapidly expanding our clinical group. Hoping by the end of the year.
- Asher bio is a start-up that focuses on developing safer, more selective cytokines. The company was founded by Asher and his co-founder Andy Young. They say they were driven by Pfizer's decision to relocate from San Francisco to San Diego. Having a small team was key to their success.
- In early 2019, you and Andy are working at Pfizer groups. It became clear it would be hard to raise a large round that is sufficient to really take these things into the clinic. So they focused on finding small rounds. They applied for Y Combinator in April and got accepted.
- By the end of YC, just three months after starting to work on this thing, what had you accomplished in just the three months since then? We ended up going developing one of our molecules from an idea on paper to treating in mice. Although it was an early prototype, it highlighted the value and the potential of the platform.
- You went from an idea to actually really promising in vivo data in just three months. Now you need to raise money from investors. You've raised over $100 million from investors today. Tell us how you did that.
- YC really wanted to stay close to science because we know really pioneering developing this new approach. And that was a major focus for us, really growing the research group. And I'm pretty excited that today we have a stellar group of rising stars and drug developers.
- How to move fast is taking small, calculated risks. When we went through YC, we were sort of working backwards from Demo Day. And it's important to continue taking these small, maybe bigger calculated risks as you go forward in order to stay fast.
- Ivana: What advice would you have for people like that or for your former selves? Andy: Take a leap of faith and to pursue your passion either in science or building company. Think about the next inflection points always and then be overly confident with investors.
