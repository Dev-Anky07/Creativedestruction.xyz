- For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, successive generations are not becoming wealthier than their parents. Younger generations are finding it harder and harder to get reliable jobs, afford comfortable homes, start a family and save for retirement. Is there some underlying cause to this?
- In the 1950s and 1960s, the global population was roughly a third of what it is today. Higher interest rates ensured that house prices never got too high. Real estate is uniquely unproductive as an asset class.
- Housing affordability can do that, and it can also slow the progress of entire economies. Every economy in the world is still, for better or worse, focused around large centers of economic activity. Higher house prices also reduce social and geographical mobility.
- The concentration of wealth in a particular generation is something that can have very real consequences for entire economies. These effects are only going to get more pronounced as populations continue to age. Blaming our current economic issues on a single generation is not going to be very productive.
