- Spencer Graham has accepted to come and share a little bit about the framework that he's developing. I find it to be pretty fundamental to the very idea of what a Dao is. If you'd like to add anything about yourself or context, please feel free to the floor is yours.
- Anticapture is creating a shared language and a foundation on which to build knowledge and practices relating to the concept of capture resistant governance. What I hope this can become is a community of practice spread across lots of different other communities to better understand what's going on.
- There are increasing benefits to pooling our resources together. But there's also lots of challenges and costs that get created. The larger the pool of resources is, the larger the things that we're sharing are. Those are some of the big challenges in governance.
- Diversion of shared resources for private benefit. Our society is riddled with capture. We now have the tools to prevent capture of resources in a fundamental way. Let's use these new tools to create better ways of working together.
- What we're using networks to do is model groups of people or groups of agents. Anytime you have multiple people that are related in some way, we can model that as a network. There's probably several different types of networks that we can describe with this framework.
- Many things within a network can be modeled as shared resources. Shared resources are anything that multiple people multiple agents can control collectively. Public ethereum state is a primary example here, but so are coordination mechanisms.
- A Discord server is kind of a coordination mechanism. There's not a great way to actually put that in control of the network as a whole. A common theme for me now is sort of identifying things that are capture vectors. Over time start to bring more things into the world of web three and smart contracts.
- The concept here is that everything that everybody does is an action. Actions in this framework have four phases. Starting with a proposed phase, moving to the decide phase to execute and then to evaluate. Each phase might introduce some vulnerabilities or some vectors that where shared resources can be captured.
- What seems to be missing in a lot of these kinds of governance models is the deliberation phase. The one tool that I found really promising is this idea of citizen assemblies. And I think that that could be added to this kind of process that would be maybe even more fair than what we're seeing developing right now.
- I think noting the fact that attention is a shared resource in this phase is also critical. I think there's a lot of stuff that needs to be teased out more. And that's an excellent example of stuff like it's kind of there, but definitely not as much and as built out.
- The execute phase is actually backing up a little bit in organizations in the way we think about everything. The decide phase is sort of the domain of influence. There is a risk of capture by people with a high degree of influence in some fashion. What we can accomplish with Dows is we can distribute the executive power or autonomy.
- When execute and decide are bundled, the tendency toward capture just comes from the way that the vote is conducted. And I think certainly there are going to be vectors for capture. Where are the largest risks toward to becoming vulnerable to capture when things happen?
- The final section of this is the evaluate phase. There is a ton of importance here with respect to transparency and access to information. Dows are the strongest form of capture resistant governance that we have thus far. People are defining their DAOs by all kinds of various stages of turning into this Dow.
- Paolo: There is a big opportunity for influence to be gained when persons participate in the evaluate phase. Would you say that there should also be a risk of losing influence, and maybe that's why most orgs don't engage. Does that mean that Dao with subdos are in DAOs?
- Andrew: I was wondering if any thought has been put into splitting the decision making phase into sort of two parts. One where you decide the goals and one where you deciding and what actions are conducive to those goals. Spencer: If you wouldn't mind maybe sharing your slides in there, either directly in the channel or you can send it to me.
