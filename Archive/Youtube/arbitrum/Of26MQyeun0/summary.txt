- Welcome to another spaces. We have Lyra with us today, and we're just a little late to get going. Why don't you guys just tell us who you are and what you do in the protocol?
- Lyra is a protocol for trading options. It allows traders to buy and sell options on crypto assets like ETH and Bitcoin. Trades occur against a pool of collateral which is managed by a smart contract. Lyra is quite different to traditional AMMS.
- An AMM is when you have a smart contract that sort of has the job of managing funds and also providing pricing for an underlying product. Instead of trading directly with a counterparty, you're trading peer to pool. There are a number of benefits to that.
- An option can either give you the right to buy or sell an asset at a given price at a future point in time. They're used for all sorts of things from commodities to stocks to interest rates. You can combine a variety of different options to create almost any payoff you can imagine.
-  options are such a useful financial tool in trading used in traditional markets, so why haven't they blown up in DeFi yet? Lyra is uniquely designed to solve the problem of that gap between speculative and more usefulness.
- And with building, I guess I'm wondering why have you guys chosen to build toward Arbitram and on Arbitram? And I guess, why now as well, if it's relevant. Lyra really only works on layer two. We're looking at Arbitram as one of the really cornerstones of this L two native DFI.
- GMX has the deepest liquidity for perpetuals on Arbitrum, which kind of made it a no brainer for us. Are there other projects you're looking to collaborate with? There's lots.
- The bread and butter integration for Lyra is the Dov or decentralized options vaults. This is awesome because it provides soft flow for LPs in Lyra as users passively buy and sell options on the other side. Expect to see new innovations in that space.
- Leveraged vault deposits. Things like treasury management strategies and productizing arbitrage opportunities. These are some really exciting areas to look into. We're also excited to see some of our current partners move across to Arbitrum alongside of us.
- Perpetuals are kind of like a future, except they never expire, they just keep going and going. The other thing about perpetuals and futures is they allow you to have leverage. Are synth assets something that will be coming, the integration with GMX and with don't?
- In a couple hours, we're going to be migrating staking from optimism to mainnet. This will do a couple of things. It'll unlock on chain staking. And it'll also improve the staking UX across chain as we move multi chain. So keep an eye out for an announcement.
- The launch of GMX on Arbitrum will happen in three phases. The first process will be to soft launch trading with a fixed amount of funds. After that, once there's liquidity in the pools, then it's kind of all clear to launch. More improvements to the system over time as we move to becoming options liquidity layer.
- You guys were one of the first layer two options protocol. So it kind of makes sense for you guys to pave the way on creating that MultiChain narrative for options. Do you have any more questions or should we field some questions from the community?
- If people want to get involved in the Dao on the Arbitram side, how would that work for them? The easiest way is just jump in discord. There's an entirely open process for you to come write a leap. Let's open it up for community questions.
- Will we still be using the SUSD as the main form of collateral, or are we moving over to something more like widespread, like USDC or something like that? We will be using USDC as well as ETH as the collateral. It should be really interesting to see how that affects the usage of the protocol.
- Do you guys have, like, a community nickname? Yeah, I'd say the Lyros. The Lyrus. They might start calling you Lyra nuts here in Arbitram. If you stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything.
- How are you different from GMX or any other option trading platforms that are on Arbitrum right now? You can buy and sell loads of different options at competitive prices with good spreads. Is it only crypto right now or are you going to have stock as well?
- Asen, welcome to the stage. Would there be now, after this, Newport integration or Newport upgrade, a potential to maybe mix different perpetual swap protocols. It would require some amendments and some considerations about how we treat collateral. This is the big project of our time.
- Will the Lyra team keep up with the stability and risk of GMX when allowing long term new option positions? Any problems with GMX, we'll be continuously monitoring. Last call for questions.
- All right, I guess that's it. Thanks a lot for taking the time out of your day. We look forward to chatting more and communicating with the Arbitram community. Good luck tonight.
