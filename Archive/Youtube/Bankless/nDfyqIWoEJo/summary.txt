- A hundred years from now, we're gonna have bubbles that would look exactly like they did in 199. Welcome to Bankless, where we are the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. How to get started, how to get Better and how to front run the opportunity.
- A lot has changed in crypto throughout the cycles. We've got timeless investing wisdom applied to crypto from writer and investor Morgan Housel. There's a few different things you need to know for different parts of the cycle. How to balance optimism and pessimism to become a better investor.
- The most significant thing about this episode is the timing in which Morgan's book just happened to come out. We are about to enter a time in which the bull market beer goggles are on. This is when the advice is the hardest to follow yet it is going to have the most ROI if you can follow it.

- Morgan Housel is a writer and investment partner at the Collaborative Fund. He's just published a new book called the same as Ever. It's a series of 23 punchy stories, timeless truths about people, societies. This is important wisdom as we go into the crypto bull market.
- The author was frustrated at how bad the financial industry was at forecasting the next bear market, the next recession. He says the same behaviors are never going to change. What's the positive way out of that? Rather than just becoming more of a cynic?
- Morgan: How people respond to greed, fear, risk, uncertainty, it's all the same. And this is same for psychology and money. The overlap between the behaviors among a crypto investor versus an index fund investor versus a mutual, there's a lot of overlap there.
- Morgan: We are going to make many of the exact same mistakes we made in the previous bull market. 100 years from now, we're going to have bubbles that would look exactly like they did in 1999. Is there hope that we could actually break this cycle as kind of a society?
- There are 23 different lessons in this. I want to break this into three different kind of sections of the conversation for different lessons, different advice. The first is bear market advice. When things are going really well, when things are exuberant, what lessons should we be listening to most. And then the advice when you're in between, it's neither bull nor beaR.
-  crypto has been in a bear market recently. We now are coming out of this. We have wounds, we have scars. Actually, the last chapter of your book is called Wounds Heal and Scars Last.
- Everyone is just like a set of mirrors reflecting what they've experienced in life. I view the world differently than you do, even if we're roughly the same age and same education. Without this idea that there is no right answer in finance, we're all just kind of mirrors of the scars.
- Negative memories get encoded into people at like ten X the rate as any other type of memory. Humans have this very strong aversion to fear. A negative comment can stick with me for a month.
- Losses hurt more than gains, feel good. A lot of that is just because of you're investing to make money. That intuition is the cause of the majority of bad investing behavior. And it all stems from the fact that you're going to experience loss so much more vividly than you do the joy of gain.
- A lot of people remember the past not as it was, but as it should have been. In hindsight, we think it was great, but it wasn't. The pain is always worse on the downside then.
- Everything worth pursuing comes with a little pain. In investing, you get paid for dealing with uncertainty and volatility. This really applies to crypto. Just acknowledging what that cost is makes a lot of difference.
- The next generation never learns anything from the previous one until it's brought home with a hammer. Nothing is more persuasive than what you've experienced firsthand. Even if you've lived through multiple bear markets, the next one's not going to be the same.
- It looks like crypto might be entering a bull market season, like bitcoin, ether, prices going up. Morgan: The worst behaviors in our industry were caused more by envy than greed. People lose their minds during bull runs.
- If we do get a bull market, our wealth is going to increase. But if our happiness doesn't increase, what's the point? Can you tell us what is the key to actually being happy?
- Morgan: How do we get off this envy treadmill here, the trap that we fall into all of the time? He says money can make you 10% happier, but the calculation for happiness includes other things. Morgan: What most people really want is a simple life. But what they're actually seeking is like high status.

- Morgan: I feel like I am at my healthiest with respect to a relationship with money when I'm using it as a tool to enhance my freedom. Morgan: For those people with high expectations not making you happy, I would frame it as social debt. There's going to be some bad incentives at play yet again.
- The biggest technology booms come when the world is on fire. It comes during wars and recessions. There can be great incentives that really push people towards getting everything right. That incentive will supercharge technology like you've never seen before.
- Morgan: The best thing you can do during a bull market is actually nothing. He says the problem of trying too hard in investing is a misunderstanding of what you have control over. Morgan: When you realize how influenced your behavior can become by the emotions of the ups and downs, it's hard to beat it.
- Morgan: To our detriment and to our entertainment, crypto bull markets are like 10,000 little doodads and widgets. He says understanding the narrative of why these things happen is incredibly important. Morgan: To say that you can just dismiss the short term is wrong.
- Do there crypto investors that dollar cost average into Bitcoin and ETH and just do that every single month? I think it's probably harder psychologically to do it in crypto because the FOMO during the bull market is more extreme than it would be in the stock market. The entire industry is kind of bad at hitting the sell button.
- Morgan: You talk in your book about the value of imperfection. It's just acknowledging how powerful room for error is in a world that's uncertain. By doing that, you're actually going to end up with the best outcome.
- Morgan: One of your chapters is juxtaposing optimism and pessimism. What is the most healthy way to be? Should we always be optimistic? Is there value in pessimism? Morgan: You need both of them to coexist at the same time.
- Very few companies have been run as conservatively as Microsoft in terms of just an absolute mountain of cash held on the balance sheet at all times. Understanding how fragile the world can be pushes you towards this level of conservatism on one end. But if you're wildly optimistic about, you can still be crazy optimistic about getting there.
- Good things happen slow, bad things happen fast. Compounding is by its nature, like a slow process, that it's really driven by the amount of time it's being done for. The way optimism and pessimism play out pushes you towards being pessimistic about the future.
- If your expectations grow with your income, you're never going to be happy with your money. And it's very difficult to do but to be grateful for what you have. Compare yourself to yourself five years ago. You're probably doing great.
- Morgan: What a perfect way to end this episode with the word gratitude. I'm grateful for everyone who listens to this podcast and bankless listener. Morgan's first appearance on Bankless, the Psychology of money. Read Morgan's new book.
