[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:00.000 ] Speaker C : The Nile goes back.
[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:05.000 ] Speaker B : A very, very, very long way. The Nile. The. The Nile river system twelve and a half thousand years ago.
[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:00:06.000 ] Speaker C : Looked much.
[ 0:00:06.000 ---> 0:00:09.000 ] Speaker B : The same as it. As it does today. The Nile river.
[ 0:00:09.000 ---> 0:00:10.000 ] Speaker C : System was pretty much.
[ 0:00:10.000 ---> 0:00:11.000 ] Speaker B : Twelve and a half thousand.
[ 0:00:11.000 ---> 0:00:12.000 ] Speaker C : Years ago the way that it is.
[ 0:00:12.000 ---> 0:00:13.000 ] Speaker B : Today. The big difference.
[ 0:00:13.000 ---> 0:00:15.000 ] Speaker C : Was that the Sahara Desert was.
[ 0:00:15.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker B : Green and fertile.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:18.000 ] Speaker A : This coincides with Dr. Robert.
[ 0:00:18.000 ---> 0:00:19.000 ] Speaker B : Shock's absolutely.
[ 0:00:19.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker A : Assertion that when you look at the temple, the Sphinx, you're dealing with thousands of years of water erosion.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:25.000 ] Speaker B : Yes.
[ 0:00:25.000 ---> 0:00:30.000 ] Speaker A : And the last time there was water like that in the Nile Valley was when?
[ 0:00:30.000 ---> 0:00:59.000 ] Speaker B : The last time you had the water erosion like that in the Nile Valley was precisely during the younger Dryas. The younger Dryas was a period of extremely heavy rains in Africa. And it's rainfall, it's erosion caused by heavy rains that is the enigma on the Great Sphinx. We're not saying that there was a flood came over the Great Sphinx. We're looking at what's called precipitation induced weathering, weathering that was caused by exposure to about a thousand years of extremely heavy rainfall. And Dr. Robert Shock puts that thousand years precisely in the younger dry Us period.
