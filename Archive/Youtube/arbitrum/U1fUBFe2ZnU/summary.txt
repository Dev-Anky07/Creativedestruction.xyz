- Let's Where We are, or Slash will be joined soon by three three members of the core Nitro team. Lee and Rachel, aka the Arbitram, as well as Sahi, who hopefully will be connected soon. We'll talk about various ways that the nitro team's moving the decentralization roadmap forward.
- Daniel: This is the tech lead for the Nitro team at Offchain Labs. Nitro is an upgrade to the Arbitrum stack that happened in August. Daniel: Lee can give a brief summary of the difference between the two.
- Instead of proving the Arbitram virtual machine, we're now able to prove a standardized virtual machine called WebAssembly. This is a very standard virtual machine that's industry wide and it's built for the web browser.
- This new Nitro stack does very similar things, but essentially does them a lot better and does them with more standardized systems that we can reuse. One day we'll have Sahi. As soon as we can, we'll do an intro for Saki.
- Stylus is a technology that's coming out this year. It allows users to deploy smart contracts written in languages besides Solidity and Viper. It also lowers the barrier to entry into web three. computations are over ten times faster on Stylus.
- Stylus is built on top of the same WASM fraud proving technology that has undergirded the entire Nitro stack. Can take contracts written in Rust, C, etc. and then execute those natively. Everything that you can do in Solidity, you'll be able to do as before.
- For this to work, gas is metered at the WASM level with stylus. Because WASM is so fast, each Opcode is way cheaper. There's two notions of gas, but ultimately they can be freely exchanged for one another.
- The thing we're delivering this year is Rust and C. And by supporting C, we also get C Plus. In principle, this structure could be extended to cover any language that can be compiled to WASM. But if the language has a large runtime, it's not something we would want to immediately focus on.
- We just announced the sort of new Arbitram Dao and the Arbitram governance system. This is an important step in moving things towards decentralization. Maybe we can talk about some of those various pieces of what we want to happen.
- The WASM module route determines what code is running on Arbitram. In theory you could change it to run any sort of code. It's one of the fundamental pieces of chain ownership. People still have to upgrade their nodes to this new version of the code.
-  ARBOs is an informal term for the parts of the state machine that we've added from Guest. This is one piece of decentralization that's not listed on the state of decentralisation. We want it to be as accessible and easy as possible to run an Arbitrum node.
- Can we talk a bit about what sort of work has been done there on the Nitrous side, particularly around Just in Time validation. We're able to now validate using WASM faster than we are than the current speed limit of the chain. The actual cost of being a validator has dramatically fallen.
- As of now, the Validators are still on a whitelist. There is an avenue to delay confirmation. A dishonest party who makes an honest claim and then loses on purpose. We think we have a solution. You can forward to that being released probably fairly soon.
- The sequencer is a part of the system that determines ordering of transactions on L. It creates what's known as latency racing. What we've proposed instead is a mechanism called time boost. Instead of trying to get as close to the sequencer as possible, we can all bid on the next transaction.
- Lee: We have seen fraud proofs work live on Mainnet. This was actually the first usage of Arbitrarium fraud proofs on a Main net. And sure enough, seven days later, I had won the challenge as designed. Not worth a ton, but still fun.
- Mark: I asked you pretty difficult, loaded questions. We got pretty in the weeds, and you did a great job of answering. I enjoyed answering them. Thanks, Daniel.
- Dow governance goes live a week from yesterday, on Thursday. Off Chain Labs will continue to develop technologies that we believe the community will benefit from. All the information is available now. You can even apply to be a delegate now.
