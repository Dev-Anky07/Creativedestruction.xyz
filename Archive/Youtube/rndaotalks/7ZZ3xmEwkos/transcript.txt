[ 0:00:05.000 ---> 0:05:37.000 ] Speaker A : Welcome to this deep democracy session. I only have 1 hour to introduce Deep Democracy and I would like to take the opportunity to, in this hour, give you an idea about what Deep Democracy is, because not many people are familiar with it. It's a mindset of philosophy and a facilitation technique. So I'm going to give you a mini intro in what Deep Democracy is about. Talk a little bit about who founded it, where it comes from, what the ideas behind are, and then I will introduce just a couple of key ideas with a mini exercise. Because Deep Democracy also has a toolbox with amazing tools that bring you just a tiny bit of a little bit of a different conversation in your communities. So I will let you have a little bit of a feel. If you really want to dive deep into deep into deep Democracy, a general introduction course might take you up to a day. And if you go really deep, the full level training takes you. Yeah, it's four modules, a bit like nonviolent communication training, so you go into models and then even into the deeper levels. But I'll give you some information about that later at the end, in case you're interested in deep diving. Now, we have this tradition in Deep Democracy to open with what we call an inclusive welcome board because it already sets the tone. And I created one for you today, so I'm going to read it to you. An inclusive warm welcome to set the space and the container for today. So good evening, everyone. It's evening here in Brussels. Maybe you're in another time zone, but a good day to you. A very warm welcome. Welcome to everyone who had to hurry here. Maybe you had to take care of some family or you had to take care of a friend. Maybe this is actually your lunchtime and you're trying to get your lunch while you're listening. Welcome to people from all over the world. Here an incredible international diversity. We did a mini round already and we are already almost all over the world, on the West Side mostly. Welcome to the different worldviews, hiding in this diversity, hiding in where you come from, where your roots are to the richness, hiding in the diversity in languages that might be present also in this group and maybe also in the ways, the different ways of expressing yourself. Welcome to people identifying as a woman, as a man, as trans, or all of these or none of those. Welcome to discovering new versions of yourself every day. Welcome to complexity. Welcome to you and what you want to show of yourself today. Welcome to whatever is alive in you today at this very moment. Welcome to who is in perfect health. Welcome to who has a disease, visible or invisible, physical, psychological. Welcome to everyone that feels peaceful today. And welcome to people feeling turbulent and all over the place this week. Last weeks, the past weeks. Welcome to anger. Also welcome to feeling sad, to feeling sometimes disconnected. Welcome to feeling exhausted, hopeless and frustrated when you witness what is happening in the world. Welcome to feelings of hope. Welcome to feeling alive, to feeling sparked, to feeling connected with yourself, with others, with nature, maybe with the universe. Probably. You feel all these things all the time, at the same time and you're completely confused very often. And a special welcome, because this is, after all, a Deep Democracy session. A special welcome to conflict, a special welcome to rage, to tension, to frustration, to all the no voices alive in your body and in your mind. And I kindly and it's nice that we're just oh, many people I have to switch screens. Sorry, I didn't notice that. And more people came in. Maybe we can because we are only eight, maybe we can add to the inclusive welcome that I've just been reading. Maybe you can add something like, as a mini check in. What do you welcome today? What feeling, what is alive? And because this is a Deep Democracy intro session, and one of the bottom lines of Deep Democracy is the wisdom is in the no voice. I'm inviting you to welcome something that is not so nice, a mini feeling that you have in yourself and that you've been pushing away. That was a bit annoying. Like, God damn it, I don't want to feel you now. A frustration, a bit of anger, a bit of disappointment. Something that's alive in yourself that's maybe not so positive today. And how do you welcome that? And if you feel comfortable, you can share that.
[ 0:05:37.000 ---> 0:05:40.000 ] Speaker B : We can do a mini round and.
[ 0:05:40.000 ---> 0:05:43.000 ] Speaker A : Whoever feels like going first can go first.
[ 0:05:44.000 ---> 0:06:05.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah. I was seeing a couple of really lovely comments in the chat. Maria was welcoming the weekend. Priya welcomed curiosity. Andrea welcomed the snow and the cold. Maria was welcoming uncertainty. I was welcoming the tension of having another screen full of pending tasks.
[ 0:06:07.000 ---> 0:06:10.000 ] Speaker A : Yes. Anything else?
[ 0:06:12.000 ---> 0:06:16.000 ] Speaker C : Shani is welcome to trying to get everything done before the weekend starts.
[ 0:06:17.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, it comes with a little bit of oh, my God. A little bit of desperation. I see despair. What else? What other mini no voices are in there today?
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:59.000 ] Speaker D : Hi, I am actually listening to this on a phone, so if I try to write it on a chant, I'm pretty sure the autocorrect will make whatever I'm trying to say in the wrong sense. So to honestly answer the questions, I welcome such things or events that shatter your belief in certain values with a deep disappointment and the sense of helplessness. Is that an honest response?
[ 0:06:59.000 ---> 0:07:06.000 ] Speaker A : Yes. Feeling of helplessness, absolutely. What else?
[ 0:07:13.000 ---> 0:07:31.000 ] Speaker E : I'm just finding the weather quite challenging. I know it's quite nothing new, but winters always make me slightly depressed because it gets dark earlier and there's nothing in your control. I've tried to go running, but I find it's quite difficult to run in the dark in the evening alone as a woman sometimes. So it's just an annoying thing, that's all.
[ 0:07:34.000 ---> 0:07:35.000 ] Speaker B : Weather.
[ 0:07:37.000 ---> 0:07:51.000 ] Speaker A : One last thing before we move on. What do you welcome as a feeling? Feeling depressed a little bit because of the winter, the little hesitation that comes with wanting to go for a run in the dark and adjusting to that.
[ 0:07:52.000 ---> 0:07:58.000 ] Speaker B : Like having to switch that a little bit there. Yeah.
[ 0:07:59.000 ---> 0:08:10.000 ] Speaker C : To the knowledge or the thinking that slowing down would be the right thing to do. But I'm actually ramping up as the autumn and winter comes.
[ 0:08:12.000 ---> 0:08:13.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:08:13.000 ---> 0:08:18.000 ] Speaker A : The polarity between wanting to slow down, but actually it's like you're speeding up.
[ 0:08:19.000 ---> 0:08:19.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:08:20.000 ---> 0:08:28.000 ] Speaker A : Attention there, polarity. All right, I'm going to share because I somehow have trouble I know I can share my screen. Of course I'll do that.
[ 0:08:28.000 ---> 0:08:48.000 ] Speaker B : That might be octo. Wait, sorry about this.
[ 0:08:54.000 ---> 0:10:23.000 ] Speaker A : There we go. All right, so for the new people in this group, I'm going to give an intro session on Deep Democracy. I'm going to talk a little bit about the iceberg, which is a very typical way of looking at groups. So for the newcomers, deep Democracy is a philosophy and a mindset, and it has a toolbox for facilitation of groups to go just a tiny little bit deeper. The bottom line of deep democracy is that we always listen into the no voice, into the tensions in the group like that you very often hear in meetings la, suddenly there's a lee, somebody that doesn't agree, and instead of pushing that mini disagreement, that mini no voice away, this becomes the superpower of deep Democracy facilitation. Because if we don't listen to it, if we don't include it in our decision making, if we don't make that voice feel heard, it will become a growing tension in the group and it will make the group explode in the end. So Deep Democracy tries to work with that no voice. So we're going to talk a little bit also about the sabotage line, which is a really nice tool to start recognizing where the novoice in your groups start playing out and then some tools. And we're going to see if we can practice just a little bit leen.
[ 0:10:23.000 ---> 0:10:27.000 ] Speaker C : If it's okay with you to click maybe on the top right, the slideshow.
[ 0:10:27.000 ---> 0:10:28.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah.
[ 0:10:30.000 ---> 0:10:30.000 ] Speaker B : Better?
[ 0:10:30.000 ---> 0:11:17.000 ] Speaker A : Yes. So what is Deep Democracy? The first one that took the Worth deep Democracy, or created the word deep Democracy was a guy called Arnold Mindel in the late 80s. He's still alive. He's running the Process Work Center in Portland, and he does process work, which is more trauma and group related trauma work. And one of his key lines are, you don't see the world the way it is, you see the world the way you are, which is one of his key mottos in life, to really challenge your perspective and go inside yourself instead of blaming others, of course. And instead of assuming that other people see things the exact same way as you do.
[ 0:11:18.000 ---> 0:11:33.000 ] Speaker C : Somehow it got stuck in just loading. So maybe let's go back to the previous thing. I don't know why this light giving us a headache today, but anyway, I think they were visible enough as it is, if that's okay with everyone. If not, let us know.
[ 0:11:33.000 ---> 0:11:35.000 ] Speaker A : Visible like this?
[ 0:11:35.000 ---> 0:11:38.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, that's fine. I'm seeing some thumbs up.
[ 0:11:38.000 ---> 0:15:53.000 ] Speaker A : Okay, cool. Another one is what is in you is in me. And what is in me is in the group. Very useful if you're in a group and you start feeling a little bit of chaos inside, or you suddenly start like, feeling a bit uncomfortable, most likely you're not the only one in the group. And this will become, this awareness that you grow will probably become your biggest advantage and your biggest opportunity to start working in the group. And he invites you always to sit in the fire. One of his quotes is also, harmony is a wonderful thing, but not nearly as powerful as awareness. So the deep democracy really dives in. That was Arnald minddell. He wrote a book, deep democracy the deep democracy of open forums, advocating for more people assemblies and for more people democracy, where we actually talk about the things that need to be talked about. In the 90s, we had a couple in South Africa, myrna Lewis and her husband, and they were asked by the government to guide a big process in an electricity company based where 5000 people worked. It was beginning of the 90s, it was post apartheid, so there was a lot of conflict and a lot of segregation between different groups of people. And they were asked to start a trauma process, healing in that company. They cut out the whole middle management in the company. People had to work together. And with the traumas that had entered the groups and the people, it was very difficult. And they were asked to solve this problem. And they knew the work of Arnold minddell, and they developed a practical toolbox and a method for inclusive decision making and conflict resolution. And they started working with those 5000 people in this company to start solving their own problems. And this is still the Lewis deep democracy toolbox that is being taught today all over the world. Myrna Lewis is also still alive, and I'm taking actually a course with her at the moment on becoming a certified trainer. And one of her baselines is mining the gold in conflict, seeing chaos and conflict as an opportunity to grow. And the growth is, of course, growing towards the potential of the group. But the most growth is of course on yourself, right? Growing awareness. Who am I, right, what are my pains? What are my struggles? What am I doing here? Where am I projecting on the group? And how can I be a better person in this group? How can I grow awareness and then take responsibility with the group to learn as a breathing community and see all relationships that you have as an opportunity for personal growth, and then you can grow to the potential of the group. So, yeah, deep democracy, the only way out is in, right? And if you see the iceberg there, deep democracy often plays with conscious and unconscious. If you see the conscious as our mind, right, this is conscious. We see our facial expressions and, oh, my God, does our mind try all the time to get out of problems? We analyze, we rationalize, we think ourselves outside out of problems, right? But the only way is in. And that is what arnaud mindel means with and that's what the word deep democracy also stands for. Deep refers to going in the body, right? And especially arnaud mindel works a lot with body work and in process work. It's a common thing to really work with the tensions in your body. Where do you feel the pain? How can you go inside? And how can we reach the potential of yourself and then of the group? So let's sit in the fire. Let's dive in and see where we go deep. Let's go deep.
[ 0:15:55.000 ---> 0:15:56.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:15:56.000 ---> 0:16:44.000 ] Speaker A : Another one. And then the larger goal of deep democracy is not me changing you and you changing me, but learning how we can relate, how can we work together? All right, let's do a mini exercise. I'm going to stop sharing just for a tiny bit so that I can see more faces. Let's do a mini exercise about this sabotage line and how it might play out. I'm going to ask you to imagine that you live in a town, and the town is being ruled by an autocrat dictator mayor. Maybe transform yourself to maybe a couple 500 years before now, right? So imagine you live in small houses. There's a town square. There is like, I don't know if you know, a guillotine. Sounds like Elon Musk.
[ 0:16:44.000 ---> 0:16:45.000 ] Speaker D : Yeah.
[ 0:16:45.000 ---> 0:17:37.000 ] Speaker A : Maybe we can call him Elon Musk. Yeah, that's actually a good oh, I have an idea. Okay, you just changed my mind. This is cool. Okay, so imagine Elon Musk is like the mayor of the town where you live. Where you live, right? And on the town square, there is a guillotine. You know, a guillotine, like the thing that cuts your head off, like this old medieval tool. Twitter's. Burke yeah. And usually I do this with the potato king, where the dictator asks the community to only eat potatoes. But let's do it like this. Let's imagine that Elon Musk is our mayor. He's a dictator, and he tells you that the only way to communicate in this town is going to be Twitter. Nothing else. No mails, no conversation, no WhatsApp, no Facebook, nothing.
[ 0:17:37.000 ---> 0:17:38.000 ] Speaker B : Twitter.
[ 0:17:38.000 ---> 0:18:07.000 ] Speaker A : And only Twitter from one day to the other, nothing else. You live in this town. You have your social contacts, you have your friends. Now imagine for two minutes. We're not too many people so we don't have to go into breakout groups. But imagine just for a minute, how would you react being in this town, being cut off from all other platforms? No slack, no discord. Maybe that's a good thing. No discord anymore. Nothing.
[ 0:18:08.000 ---> 0:18:10.000 ] Speaker B : Just Twitter.
[ 0:18:11.000 ---> 0:18:19.000 ] Speaker A : What would you do? You are limited. What would you do?
[ 0:18:21.000 ---> 0:18:22.000 ] Speaker B : So it's a.
[ 0:18:24.000 ---> 0:18:33.000 ] Speaker A : Authoritarian decision. You have no and he says like no, Twitter is good. Solves all your problems. You can communicate like you don't need anything else.
[ 0:18:39.000 ---> 0:18:40.000 ] Speaker D : Can we say?
[ 0:18:40.000 ---> 0:18:51.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, go ahead. What would you do? We just do our rounds of voices and to hear how really imagine if this would happen to you. What would you do as a person? As a person in this town? Yes, go ahead.
[ 0:18:52.000 ---> 0:19:28.000 ] Speaker D : I would actually calculate the probability of me being able to employ a positive change somewhat. I will take a temperature check of the residents and I don't have a better word for temperature check. Hence I use the jargon. I will try to find out what other people think about this. And if as a group the town thinks that he is just too powerful, then rational thinking tells me that if I fight this alone, it will be my neck on the guillotine. I will most probably try to move.
[ 0:19:30.000 ---> 0:19:37.000 ] Speaker A : So the first reaction I hear is that you will try to hear the opinion of others. Right? Like as a first response.
[ 0:19:40.000 ---> 0:20:12.000 ] Speaker D : I will try to understand what minimum viability strength do a community need to oppose this tyranical decision. And without that minimum viable group resisting this move, if it is just me standing up and shouting in the town score saying this is not the way to go, I will essentially calculate what are the chances that my neck would be on the guillotine. And if that is higher than the other, I'll most probably move.
[ 0:20:14.000 ---> 0:20:16.000 ] Speaker A : Cool. Any other voices?
[ 0:20:17.000 ---> 0:20:35.000 ] Speaker C : I was noticing myself sorry, I'll pass on strategy after I was noticing myself just trying to imagine what it would be like and trying to map what that leads to. And already like creating some scenario planning.
[ 0:20:36.000 ---> 0:20:42.000 ] Speaker A : Strategic thinking. To do what? Actually don't know yet.
[ 0:20:42.000 ---> 0:20:45.000 ] Speaker C : First to understand what it means to understand.
[ 0:20:45.000 ---> 0:20:46.000 ] Speaker A : Nice.
[ 0:20:49.000 ---> 0:21:00.000 ] Speaker F : Sean'S question. Right? I mean, my first instinct, whether it's all Twitter or if it's all potatoes is know just leave.
[ 0:21:04.000 ---> 0:21:05.000 ] Speaker B : What else?
[ 0:21:06.000 ---> 0:21:28.000 ] Speaker G : I kind of echo what Andrea is saying is like in this world that we're working in now, I think there is a lower barrier to moving on. And if there is, in that case I'm like I would just move. I would just go someplace else. There's too many options. There's too many fun places to be. I would just pick up and go find someplace more fun that I could use.
[ 0:21:28.000 ---> 0:21:29.000 ] Speaker D : Slack?
[ 0:21:29.000 ---> 0:21:31.000 ] Speaker G : No, something else.
[ 0:21:33.000 ---> 0:22:10.000 ] Speaker E : I guess I was probably thinking about, wow, this is such a relief because I hate the fact that I have so many different channels and I still find it hard to meet up with my friends because I've missed seeing Instagram or Discord or some LinkedIn message. I was thinking about the time before social media when we had a phone. We could just use a phone and like a landline and make a call and make an appointment. So maybe I just was getting romantic about this idea of, great, now we only have a single medium and actually we'll get to meet all these people, which I probably keep missing on other channels.
[ 0:22:14.000 ---> 0:22:15.000 ] Speaker A : One more maybe.
[ 0:22:21.000 ---> 0:22:24.000 ] Speaker D : Can I just come up and say, sean, please take me.
[ 0:22:24.000 ---> 0:22:25.000 ] Speaker A : With you as well?
[ 0:22:26.000 ---> 0:22:30.000 ] Speaker D : If you know too many places that are fair, please take me as well.
[ 0:22:30.000 ---> 0:22:31.000 ] Speaker G : You can join. I'm inclusive.
[ 0:22:34.000 ---> 0:22:40.000 ] Speaker A : Manuel, Tyler or Maria. Any voices, anything, how would you react?
[ 0:22:49.000 ---> 0:22:50.000 ] Speaker B : Hey there, nice to meet you.
[ 0:22:50.000 ---> 0:22:55.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I just joined recently. So what was the question again?
[ 0:22:55.000 ---> 0:22:55.000 ] Speaker B : Sorry.
[ 0:22:56.000 ---> 0:23:11.000 ] Speaker A : No worries. Yeah, I'd have to go back, but I will explain and maybe give a bit of a summary. It's going to take us too much back to explain. Okay, yeah, no worries, no worries. But it's a pleasure to be here.
[ 0:23:11.000 ---> 0:23:12.000 ] Speaker B : Thanks for organizing.
[ 0:23:12.000 ---> 0:23:13.000 ] Speaker A : Thank you for joining.
[ 0:23:14.000 ---> 0:23:14.000 ] Speaker B : Thank you.
[ 0:23:15.000 ---> 0:32:41.000 ] Speaker A : So we're doing a little bit of an exercise here, playing that Elon Musk would be the mayor of our town, and he would tell us in a very dictatorial, autocratic way, like, hey, we're going to use Twitter and only Twitter, and nothing else is large. And if you use anything else, we will cut your hats on the guillotine. Right? And we were testing a little bit what people would do. A lot of us would move and there's also somebody that's like, actually, this is not too bad. It's a bit tiring to have all these options, so it will feel like a relief. Maybe it will bring me more happiness, right? If we would do that with the potato king, maybe I'm going to use that one next time. I think it works a little bit better. What you see is that you have the whole range of people being more the opportunist. It's like, oh, great, I'll start myself like a snack bar with potatoes. I will get rich in no time. I'm going to do a cookbook. Those are more the liberals, entrepreneurs in the town to the rebels who make undergrounds and start importing couscous or rice or whatever they like, from other towns to starting a whole social movement of people resisting the mayor, right? So you see all the ways in society and it's super nice because usually in groups, it also plays out like this, right? In fractals, it's not the same as you having a potato king or Elon Musk saying Twitter. But if a decision doesn't land on you like you want it to land, or if you don't feel hurt in the decision, all these sabotage feelings that you feel right now, I'm leaving. Like, if this company is doing it like that. I've got a whole lot of other options. I'm out, I'm going to another company, right? Or to another option, et cetera, et cetera, right? So if you connect to yourself and in the way that you respond to an autocratic or when your voice is not heard, this is exactly how it will play out in your community as well. And that's why Deep Democracy is advocating so much for I'm going to share my screen again for listening to the no voices, because the wisdom is right there. The wisdom is right where people are a little bit hesitant to share, right? So if you see here you can see my screen now. Yeah. If you see here the iceberg that is the group, right? And there's a lot and the potential is all the way at the bottom. There's the gold. That's where when you really go. But there's the terrorist line in between the sharks, right? And if you don't hear the people and if you don't see the sharks and if the terrorist line starts playing, then of course you have people moving before you reach the full potential. And this is the resistance line is a nice tool to start using in your meetings, for example, to see where people are not expressing what they really think, right? And usually it's because they favor harmony instead of growing to awareness as a group or to avoid conflict. A lot of people are conflict avoidance. How do you see that in a more covered way? People start making uneasy jokes. They start laughing a little bit, right? Or they start making sarcastic jokes that are not really funny anymore. If you're aware of that, then it's like, what is playing there? Or they start finding excuses for not showing up in meetings not once, but twice, but three times. They start gossiping. It's a very human thing to do, to start looking for allies, right? And I don't know about other cultures, I'm Flemish. And a very typical thing to do here in Flanders is that everybody says in the meeting, yes. Oh, that's a great idea. I'm going to do that. And then at the coffee machine, they're like, no way, right? And they start finding the allies between their colleagues, like, are you going to do that? He's crazy. I'm not going to do that. Seriously, I've got already so much to do, and you start gossiping. Did you see what and there's this bonding happening at a coffee machine that is completely sabotaging the whole company, right? It's completely sabotaging the whole meeting because people don't dare to say what they really think at the meeting. So in the Flemish culture, it's really engraved. It's a real problem. It's the reason why some companies go move really slow, because nobody actually does what has been decided because of not being able to be authentic or not having a learn to be authentic in a meeting poor communication breakdown, not sending emails anymore, active disruption. And then you have the anger outbursts in the meeting. Well, nobody ever listens to me. Angry leaves that sort of behavior. Or going extremely slow too. Of course, in society, we see it now with the strikes, the climate strikes, for example. You see a lot of strikes happening, protests. Terrorism is also here, right? Big, big, no voices in society. Destruction here also is burnout. It's a more silent way of saying no to what is happening, but burnout having a disease, having to leave work or society for a long time, and our society has a way of dealing with this. Like, hey, you go isolate for a couple of months or even a year, you go isolate, take good care of yourself, and when you're healed, you can come back. This is the way that society takes care of this. Instead of bringing and providing a warm community, we isolate people with their Bernards and their disease, and when they are healed, they can come back. Of course, if the company hasn't changed, things go back to normal. I'm simplifying things to make a point here. And then, of course, there's war, withdrawal, and then you have the very open way of saying no. And that's leaving it's. Moving out of the town of Elon Musk, like, hell no, I'm not doing this, I'm leaving. You leave the company, right, you go away. So if you start seeing this, you somehow nurture a little bit of awareness in that or have a conversation sometimes, like, hey, I noticed this, I noticed that maybe a private conversation can also be a group conversation. I notice that there's jokes being made that aren't really funny here, right? And daring to put that on the table, it requires quite a bit of a culture change and quite a little bit of growing from the team to go there. So what does Deep Democracy offer? Yeah, this is one of you see the iceberg here. Again, it has a decision making model that is based on consent making. It's similar to sociocracy way of making decisions, but it also works with consent. It's in five steps, you have debates, and we're going to do one now, in a minute. Debating in Deep Democracy is just a little different and we're going to try to do one. You have soft, chew shuffles to mine the collective intelligence. We do a lot of throwing arrows when it gets really tough and when we really need to create a space where things need to be said, need to be said, things that sometimes they're hiding. We throw arrows at each other. We do a lot of role mapping to make it impersonal, to sort of get the voices out and the roles out, and then we have those roles talk to each other, which is very often very interesting because you depersonalize it a little bit and then people can take it back inside afterwards. Otherwise, it can get really rough. There's a couple of tools to do conflict resolution when there's a conflict between two people. It's called a let's talk, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a whole toolbox of 40 tools. I don't know if you're familiar with liberating structures. It's also a toolbox. Deep democracy is very like it's. They are they are very much complementary, as I say. Yeah. It's just that deep democracy is really about going deep into the body, whereas liberating structure is more on the when everything goes well, liberating structures, it works really well. Deep democracy takes this extra step in depth. All right, are there any questions up till now? Before we dive into a little bit of an exercise, is there anything on your mind burning?
[ 0:32:41.000 ---> 0:32:46.000 ] Speaker D : Could you please share that slideshow on the chat box, please? Is that okay?
[ 0:32:46.000 ---> 0:32:55.000 ] Speaker A : Of course. Yeah, absolutely. When I stop sharing, I'll definitely do that, for sure.
[ 0:32:55.000 ---> 0:33:02.000 ] Speaker B : Yes. Any questions?
[ 0:33:03.000 ---> 0:33:29.000 ] Speaker D : Right now, I'm looking at the picture of meta skills, and on the left side, I see a guy about to jump into waters with big fish. What does that signify, if I may? Does that mean he shouldn't do it? Or looking at deep democracy, the picture of deep democracy under the umbrella, I see a person who's confused on the ledge of the iceberg just above water.
[ 0:33:29.000 ---> 0:33:31.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, here.
[ 0:33:31.000 ---> 0:33:40.000 ] Speaker D : Yes, exactly. So I'm thinking of, is he confused as to whether to jump into the water with the sharks, the big fish?
[ 0:33:42.000 ---> 0:35:00.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah. It's a very typical situation. It's a big alarm when groups do not make a decision. We are right there, right now, in our dao regions, unite very much on finance. So we keep circling and nobody dares to take the decision. This is the exact point where you feel like there's stuff under the waterline that's not being said. And we call that in the democracy circling and edging, we always come back and back and back, and it feels like the group is stuck. Right. We're back to that. We're back to that. And it seems like there's no breakthrough and there's no way out. This means that there's things that are not set, things under the waterline that are not being shared. And then the tools. The debate, for example, helps you if you then start doing a debate and really start fishing because it sometimes requires a bit of an exercise to see what is playing here, what is not being said in this group, what is unexpressed, and then a debates or throwing arrows or soft chill. All those tools then can then help you to go just a tiny bit deeper and to go fishing.
[ 0:35:01.000 ---> 0:35:02.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:35:04.000 ---> 0:35:29.000 ] Speaker A : It also has a lot about ranking what ranks are playing out in the group that we haven't been talking about or are not aware of assumptions that we have about each other. And then you really dive in. You take the deep dive. What is playing in. The group here. Why don't we come to a decision here?
[ 0:35:30.000 ---> 0:35:31.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:35:33.000 ---> 0:36:06.000 ] Speaker D : May I make a very negative assumption and say that everybody in the top is colluding with each other because the stakes are so high. So you're looking up and you see a table of a council of ten people, and all of them are colluding with each other, publicly fighting, but privately agreeing, pushing something together, but fighting about it in the open. What does someone do in that instance? It seems like all the Sharks are a team. And you're just not fighting one shark. You're fighting, like 15 species of sharks.
[ 0:36:10.000 ---> 0:36:16.000 ] Speaker A : I can't follow is this like a comment on the picture or I will go back.
[ 0:36:16.000 ---> 0:36:22.000 ] Speaker D : You remember you said this is the situation regards to the region's finance part, this moment? Yeah.
[ 0:36:22.000 ---> 0:36:25.000 ] Speaker A : We have a situation like that going. Yeah.
[ 0:36:25.000 ---> 0:37:07.000 ] Speaker D : I am also part of a team that is trying to come up with governance framework for a protocol, and somebody has been appointed with a lot of money to sit at the top, and he's inviting all the team members or the community to come together and form this, but they actually put something out. So when you suggest something that is so obvious, they agree to it in public and they say they are going to do this, but none of them take any decision. They did not change anything about it at all. So, in effect, even though the Sharks are fighting amongst each other at the surface of the water, seems like they're having a party at the bottom of it.
[ 0:37:08.000 ---> 0:37:08.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:37:10.000 ---> 0:38:07.000 ] Speaker A : I think this is a perfect prompt for the debate that we can do a perfect intro for a debate. So debating in deep democracy is just a little bit different than a regular debate. We don't have a conversation. What we do here is try to define two roles that we have debate with each other, and we all first take one side, and then we all take the other side. I'll guide you through it. We never do a debate or anything in the democracy without setting the safe space rules, bracepace rules. There's three standard rules. The first one is there is no monopoly on the truth. What you say can just be as right as what another person says. It all is all context. It's all perspective. You don't see the world the way it is. You see the world the way you are.
[ 0:38:07.000 ---> 0:38:07.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:38:07.000 ---> 0:38:38.000 ] Speaker A : So you can be just as right as another person. We do this because we want to stay connected. You practice deep democracy and these tools in a group because you want to because you want to stay together, because you want to reach the full potential. And you also commit to we do this to learn something about yourself and each other. So it's a commitment to the group. I want to be here. I want to stay involved.
[ 0:38:38.000 ---> 0:38:39.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:38:39.000 ---> 0:39:33.000 ] Speaker A : I want to do this effort and you also commit to opening up, to learning something about yourself, which is an invitation for vulnerability. It's an invitation for being authentic. And that's once you start practicing it, I also put it in the title. It's sitting in the fire. It's lighting the fire in your team. But it's also creating trust. Because if everybody starts opening up and gets that invitation of, hey, let's be authentic, then you also build trust, and you really grow to a human company or a human organization. All right, so that were the safe rules. No monopoly on the truth. We do this to connect. We do this to learn. Usually we go into a conversation about is there anything else that you need? But I think for now, we're set.
[ 0:39:34.000 ---> 0:39:38.000 ] Speaker B : We're going to do a debate between.
[ 0:39:38.000 ---> 0:40:00.000 ] Speaker A : Two roles, and that is one, to speak. Do I speak up about those people that say they're going to make decisions than ever? Do I speak up about something or do I not speak? To speak or not to speak? We're going to have those two roles talk to each other.
[ 0:40:00.000 ---> 0:40:00.000 ] Speaker B : All right?
[ 0:40:00.000 ---> 0:40:23.000 ] Speaker A : And I'm going to stop sharing the screen, and I'm going to invite you to first all get into the role of to speak. What would be all your reasons to speak up in a group? Let's first do our rounds on that.
[ 0:40:23.000 ---> 0:40:25.000 ] Speaker B : For two, three minutes.
[ 0:40:25.000 ---> 0:40:27.000 ] Speaker A : All the reasons to speak up.
[ 0:40:32.000 ---> 0:40:33.000 ] Speaker B : Because.
[ 0:40:33.000 ---> 0:40:58.000 ] Speaker D : I've never been able to shut up. It has always been counterproductive. Whatever I have said, I have said it simply out of the necessity of not being able to shut up. It was never a logical decision. It not do any good to me at all. But most often it is because by nature, I simply cannot shut down. If I shut up, I just move on.
[ 0:40:58.000 ---> 0:41:06.000 ] Speaker A : Okay. Because it's no other option. All right. Anything else? Why would you speak up? Andrea this is a pretty comfortable role.
[ 0:41:06.000 ---> 0:41:15.000 ] Speaker F : For me also, but I tend to be the person who's really quiet, and then as soon as I hear something, somebody says something stupid.
[ 0:41:15.000 ---> 0:41:16.000 ] Speaker B : Right?
[ 0:41:17.000 ---> 0:41:29.000 ] Speaker F : So it's the reaction to what somebody else said, no, that's not true, or I don't believe that, or there's a problem with that. And that drives me to talk.
[ 0:41:30.000 ---> 0:41:33.000 ] Speaker C : Now I know next time it explains everything I know.
[ 0:41:33.000 ---> 0:42:13.000 ] Speaker H : Daniel for me, it would be to inspire others to speak, right? I'm usually the one that'll jump off the cliff first. And that's usually because I've realized if I don't inspire that, everyone nods their head, says yes, and then when the meeting ends, they all come to me and want to talk about it anyway. And then I'd waste hours to 2 hours of my day trying to work through issues that could have been worked through in the meeting. So I'll call on people, post speaking and do anything that I can to try to especially when you have a deep understanding for those within the democracy. Right. And, you know, kind of where people's heads are at. You can guide conversation by leading to speak and hoping that others will participate.
[ 0:42:13.000 ---> 0:42:35.000 ] Speaker A : All right. I hear some sense of responsibility. I hear a sense of inspiring other people. I hear a sense of urgency in the voices here. I cannot shut up now. I feel a sense of, no, it's just we have to do it. There's no other option here. Like, come on, what else is there? Why would you speak?
[ 0:42:46.000 ---> 0:43:12.000 ] Speaker G : So every now and then so every now and then I'll throw out an idea that might be contrarian. Just because I think contrarian ideas help people think differently. Even if I may not be 100% be supportive of it, just because in our organizations, I think we get settled in with too much group think, and people are just like, yeah, okay, I'm here, but I'm really doing something else. So if you throw out something contrarian, you kind of shock people and they wake up and then they start participating.
[ 0:43:12.000 ---> 0:43:13.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:43:13.000 ---> 0:43:22.000 ] Speaker A : I feel like I contribute to the group by sharing out of the box ideas. So part of responsibility. Yeah, take my responsibility.
[ 0:43:23.000 ---> 0:43:45.000 ] Speaker H : Sometimes you just have to check authority to make sure that they know that they're not always just right. If no one else is going to say something, and if the group consensus traditionally, like at the water cooler is no, but everyone nods yes, somebody's got to say something. And then usually I resonate with the fact that they're not always right. So I'll be the one that has to do it every time if I must.
[ 0:43:45.000 ---> 0:43:54.000 ] Speaker A : I hear a rebel. It's a bit of a rebel. Super cool. Anything else? Priya, do you have something? Why would you speak?
[ 0:43:54.000 ---> 0:45:03.000 ] Speaker E : You think I put a note also in the chat? I guess a lot of speaking also comes down to some of the cultural values and beliefs. I know that some people in some cultures would not talk, like, say, in a meeting, but would resolve things one to one offline because there's a concept of saving face in certain cultures, so everybody will nod. And yes, it's not just the coffee stuff, but I think there are different ways in which you can have a conversation. And I understand that in a democracy, if we think about everybody speaking and everybody being heard, but if we really try and not focus on the concept of democracy, but more about how do you arrive at a consensus? It could happen in Asynchronous or synchronous. A team meeting might not be the best place to force a decision. There are other ways to carry on. So I personally feel like in the end, it's about being effective. If you want to bring energy to a meeting, yes, you can be the clown, or you could say something to enlighten a meeting. If you know how other people work, you might do it in a way which helps them save space. So it really depends on the context.
[ 0:45:03.000 ---> 0:45:17.000 ] Speaker A : Okay. I'm going to catch the part because you were making bridges already. I'm going to catch the part where it says, like, I speak and then I heard the voice. Sometimes it's the most effective thing to do to come to a decision to speak up.
[ 0:45:17.000 ---> 0:45:18.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:45:18.000 ---> 0:45:34.000 ] Speaker A : I'm going to take that one and add it to the yes voices. I'm going to do it because it's most effective in some context, but we leave that behind for a bit. Right? It's most effective. Daniel, do you want to add one? Speak.
[ 0:45:34.000 ---> 0:45:35.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:45:35.000 ---> 0:45:37.000 ] Speaker C : Well, there was something about.
[ 0:45:39.000 ---> 0:45:40.000 ] Speaker B : Adding perspective.
[ 0:45:40.000 ---> 0:45:50.000 ] Speaker C : When you have a point that hasn't been considered. I don't know. I end up in a lot of debates where I feel that people are just missing the point.
[ 0:45:53.000 ---> 0:45:54.000 ] Speaker A : And then you speak.
[ 0:45:54.000 ---> 0:45:55.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:45:55.000 ---> 0:45:59.000 ] Speaker C : Because I'm like, no, let's just cut to the chase. It's about this.
[ 0:45:59.000 ---> 0:46:00.000 ] Speaker B : Okay.
[ 0:46:00.000 ---> 0:46:03.000 ] Speaker A : Because you know better. I'm teasing a bit.
[ 0:46:04.000 ---> 0:46:06.000 ] Speaker C : No, but that's the assumption.
[ 0:46:06.000 ---> 0:46:06.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:46:08.000 ---> 0:46:29.000 ] Speaker A : All right. Because I'm aware of the time. Let's switch to the other side. And I love this because I feel that we have a lot of speakers in the group. Right. We don't have a group of shy people, so okay. Put your feet in the other side. Why would you shut up? Why would you not speak?
[ 0:46:29.000 ---> 0:46:37.000 ] Speaker D : I don't care. I don't care. That's the only reason I keep silent when something is happening. I don't really care about this anymore.
[ 0:46:37.000 ---> 0:46:40.000 ] Speaker A : When you stop caring yeah.
[ 0:46:40.000 ---> 0:46:45.000 ] Speaker H : You're burnt out. You've tried to resolve problems before. You know your voice isn't being heard.
[ 0:46:45.000 ---> 0:46:52.000 ] Speaker A : Even if it's being used, then, wow. When you don't speak, it's sabotage.
[ 0:46:53.000 ---> 0:46:54.000 ] Speaker B : Interesting.
[ 0:46:54.000 ---> 0:47:08.000 ] Speaker C : Or, I don't know, as a facilitator, sometimes when the thing is happening and I don't need to put any extra effort or something, like, essentially it's already working. Let me not shake up what is working?
[ 0:47:08.000 ---> 0:47:09.000 ] Speaker A : Well.
[ 0:47:13.000 ---> 0:47:17.000 ] Speaker F : For me, it's often I am listening.
[ 0:47:18.000 ---> 0:47:18.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:47:18.000 ---> 0:47:41.000 ] Speaker F : It's very easy for me to leap in and start talking. And I am sensitive to the fact that that pushes other people's voices down. But it's interesting because for me, that's a point in time shift. It's not a role to roll. I'm not the person who doesn't talk or the person who speaks up. I am like I am now listening, not speaking.
[ 0:47:41.000 ---> 0:47:42.000 ] Speaker A : Okay.
[ 0:47:43.000 ---> 0:47:44.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:47:44.000 ---> 0:47:51.000 ] Speaker A : Is it a way of sensing into the group, like, which role has not been picked up yet? And then the listening role.
[ 0:47:52.000 ---> 0:48:13.000 ] Speaker F : Yeah. And making sure it's out there. Is asking a question the same thing as speaking up? Because that's my brand, actually. The person who sits there really quietly and then asks a question, and everybody goes like, oh, shit. We didn't think that.
[ 0:48:13.000 ---> 0:48:18.000 ] Speaker A : It depends on the context, probably where we can categorize it under speaking up.
[ 0:48:19.000 ---> 0:48:47.000 ] Speaker F : I have an award back there for the person with, like, the I have to get the right phrasing. He uses inquiry as a weapon right. When you ask a question and it's an intense like an undermining versus an open question of just, I'm trying to help. Lifting that short answer is, yeah, Thread has heard that has had me do that to him.
[ 0:48:51.000 ---> 0:48:52.000 ] Speaker A : A last one.
[ 0:48:52.000 ---> 0:49:05.000 ] Speaker H : Not personally, but I know people don't speak out of fear. Sometimes, depending on the authoritarian structure, they feel that if they were to try to rock the boat that there could be, like, backlash or reprisal from it.
[ 0:49:07.000 ---> 0:49:07.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:49:08.000 ---> 0:49:09.000 ] Speaker A : Out of fear.
[ 0:49:09.000 ---> 0:49:10.000 ] Speaker B : Yes.
[ 0:49:11.000 ---> 0:49:37.000 ] Speaker A : All right. Yeah, I'm aware of the time. I only have five minutes, but I'm going to close it here. Is there anything in this debate? So we've researched just a tiny bit. We can go on and on about this, right? We can go deeper and deeper. But is there anything that touched you in a way that was surprising, something that you learned? Like, oh, gosh. Oh, wow. Yeah. About in the no and in the yes, like in the speak and the not speak.
[ 0:49:38.000 ---> 0:49:46.000 ] Speaker F : I want to echo Priya's point about the importance of saving face, of saving other people's face. I think that's key.
[ 0:49:50.000 ---> 0:49:52.000 ] Speaker A : Anything else that you learned, like, oh.
[ 0:49:54.000 ---> 0:50:12.000 ] Speaker G : I like how you draw the line between the no and linking that to that's going to cause all the other discord that you're going to hear. So if you get to the no, acknowledge it, even if you don't solve it, maybe some of that discord that happens later on goes away. So I think that's powerful.
[ 0:50:14.000 ---> 0:50:15.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:50:15.000 ---> 0:50:25.000 ] Speaker D : I'm a bit inspired by the irreverence with which the gentleman said, hey, I am not going to fear away from fighting the authority. I'm a bit inspired in that sense, sir.
[ 0:50:29.000 ---> 0:50:44.000 ] Speaker H : I did graduate from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which is the Running Rebels. So it's kind of like Imbued in me. So I remember my dad telling me when I would complain about corporate, you can't be a rebel forever. And I'm like, no, but I literally am forever.
[ 0:50:45.000 ---> 0:50:46.000 ] Speaker B : Nice.
[ 0:50:48.000 ---> 0:51:44.000 ] Speaker A : Yeah, I mixed it up a little bit. So usually when you do a debate like this, right? And even when your organization is, like, on the circling and edging, and we cannot have a decision, define which two things, which two polarities are playing, is it to speak or not to speak? But mostly it's something else, a Polarity, and have those two roles debate each other on this. Like, all stand in this side. All stand in that side. And then instead of going towards a decision, immediately ask people, like, hey, what touched you? What new insight did you get? Like, oh, my God, I had no idea that Priya would I always assumed that, but, oh, wow, it really touched me, seriously. And usually when something touches you, it's a very nice opportunity to go a little bit inside, right? Like shit.
[ 0:51:44.000 ---> 0:51:44.000 ] Speaker B : Why?
[ 0:51:44.000 ---> 0:52:01.000 ] Speaker A : Why did I suddenly feel angry or frustrated? And then you invite people to be vulnerable and to share that because that's where the gold is and where you actually can grow to authenticity with the group. All right, I'm going to see.
[ 0:52:03.000 ---> 0:52:03.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah.
[ 0:52:04.000 ---> 0:53:12.000 ] Speaker A : I'll send you the slides. I added a quote in the end of a lady that I admire a lot. She's called Margaret Wheatley. She's written. Her latest book is called Who Do We Choose to Be? She talks about new leadership also in the new science, the more quantum and holistic way of being a leader. And she talks about the importance of relationships. Everything in an organization is relationships. And the more authentic you can relate right. The more powerful your organization becomes. That sort of philosophy. Well, that thank you very much. This was a very brief intro into Deep Democracy. I can go on for three days, if you would like, and have you explore all the 40, the tools and there's so much in there so much in there to work with in a different way than just talking about practical stuff. You really also go, like, getting to know each other, the relational weaving without it being too it still stays professional, but it's relational weaving, community building.
[ 0:53:15.000 ---> 0:54:15.000 ] Speaker D : Can I ask a doubt, if I may? In the previous instance, when you stand up to opposing factions, to a debate, and ask them to engage in this activity of thinking when you might speak and when you might choose to be silent. Contrary to what you mentioned, is it also not a possibility that the terrorists become more indoctrinated and the pacifists decide to be more passive? Does it not pose a problem that it might polarize these opinions further? Is it not a possibility when you stand them up in a group and you hear as a crowd to two opinions and there is a crowd which believes in one thing and the other crowd believes in something else, even after listening to each other's perspective, might it not lead to more polarization? Is it not a risk?
[ 0:54:16.000 ---> 0:54:37.000 ] Speaker A : Most of the tools in Deep Democracy will actually not go to expressing opinions and perspectives. They go just a tiny bit deeper. But it takes a little while to understand that your opinion to sort of disconnect your opinion with you as a person. And it takes a little bit of.
[ 0:54:37.000 ---> 0:54:40.000 ] Speaker B : Time to get there with the group.
[ 0:54:40.000 ---> 0:54:42.000 ] Speaker A : Like, this is just a voice that.
[ 0:54:42.000 ---> 0:54:45.000 ] Speaker B : Is alive in me, right?
[ 0:54:45.000 ---> 0:55:04.000 ] Speaker A : It's just a voice and I express it. And with the save and the bracepace rules, you really invite people to question that. And if they decide afterwards, if they become conscious of the patterns and these strong opinions that they hold, then they can choose themselves to stay in their.
[ 0:55:04.000 ---> 0:55:06.000 ] Speaker B : Yes or no, right?
[ 0:55:06.000 ---> 0:55:36.000 ] Speaker A : But it becomes a really aware it becomes a conscious process of really going deeper and deeper in who am I, actually? It really invites who am I? Who do I choose to be in this group? Is it my best behavior to really stand in my perspective. Maybe sometimes, yes. And I think climate activists like extinction, rebellion, for example, at this very moment, they really choose to stay in that no voice. And it's powerful. It's very powerful.
[ 0:55:37.000 ---> 0:55:37.000 ] Speaker B : Right.
[ 0:55:37.000 ---> 0:56:08.000 ] Speaker A : Are they activists in every aspect of their life? No, but they make the conscious choice to do this. And so you can start with this awareness of what you're doing. This is a beautiful way of relating because it's very authentic and yeah. Anyway, so in the talks and in the tool, there's very rarely, like a person to person perspective and opinion fights. No, actually, never.
[ 0:56:09.000 ---> 0:56:56.000 ] Speaker D : I might be stupid and I might be stupid in my question, but when we say this, are we not assuming that people are including myself? I'm not dissect or removing me from my question, ma'am. Are we not assuming that people are capable of acknowledging the mistakes in their opinion and going back and changing them? We are assuming a certain level of goodness. What if the stakes are so high, for example, if there is a financial motivation to remain false despite acknowledging that what you are saying is not true? How does it affect this practice? If I may, again, I might be naive.
[ 0:56:56.000 ---> 0:57:43.000 ] Speaker A : See you, Andrea. Thank you. You were waving. Well, I don't know. I'm going to quote Arnold Mindel here. The goal of the democracy is not you changing me and me changing you. I'm not going to change you. I'm looking for a way to relate to you, and that starts within me, not in you. You have no responsibility for that. No, I take my own responsibility. I know it's a little bit like I know I sometimes get really angry with somebody's opinion. I really do. But, yeah, I cannot change that person. I can only change myself. I can only start with me and choosing who I am.
[ 0:57:44.000 ---> 0:57:46.000 ] Speaker B : So, yeah.
[ 0:57:48.000 ---> 0:57:51.000 ] Speaker A : It's also a bit of a soft way out. I know that.
[ 0:57:51.000 ---> 0:57:53.000 ] Speaker B : Thank you, guys. Have a good day.
[ 0:57:53.000 ---> 0:57:56.000 ] Speaker A : Thank you so much for being here. Thank you.
