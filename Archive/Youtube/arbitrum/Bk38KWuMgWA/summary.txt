- Arbitram Orbit is the ability to permissionlessly launch chains as L Three S on top of Arbitram One or Arbitrum Nova. It opens up a huge area of possible weird new cool designs that people can work on. The number of different pretty cool advantages to having your own chain are going to be really interesting for protocols to explore.
- Next one up would be gas price reliability. Using Celestia for data availability is possible if you can customize the protocol logic building in your own governance system. New forms of cross chain communication. And then finally, alternate sequencing models.
- When you have Stylus on the underlying chain you're going to be able to do some really interesting things. And I think we'll see over time that L Three chains start to look much more advanced than L Two chains. Making transactions on Ethereum is much more expensive than Arbor from one.
- We released a tool that allows anybody to launch their own Orbit chain on testnet. Currently only roll up chains are supported through this and we're adding support for any trust chains as well. When is this actually going to be kind of in everybody's hands?
- The world is not yet completely ready for the idea of there being many chains. Chains will have interoperability, but they won't have the same level of synchronous composability that you get being on a single chain. If one of those features is kind of interesting and exciting to you, it's very much something that you should check out.
