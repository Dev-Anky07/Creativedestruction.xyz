- Today is a chain link automation workshop. Mike Stone from Chainlink as well as Adesh and Danger from DFI Edge protocol. We'll get started by explaining what chainlink automation is, the benefits of it, and how Arbitrum devs can use automation.
- Mike Stone is the go to market lead for automation at Chainlink Labs. Declare is a product manager at the company. We'll be taking a little Q and A at the end. If you have questions, feel free to hold them until then.
- If you think about modern Web Three DApps, you really need automation. Most decentralized applications are fairly simple when you compare them to traditional Web Two apps. This is really where automation steps in to help you build experiences.
- We use a decentralized network of nodes and what these nodes do is they will constantly check your job. And when they find that the contract or the upkeep is eligible, it'll then transmit the transaction on chain. Through our data feeds on chain and in automation, we've also executed upward of a couple of million transactions.
- Why do you want to use automation? I guess the real benefit comes down to four things. automation that is not reliable doesn't really count as automation. It should enable innovation. Thirdly, it should accelerate scaling. And finally, it's really about cost savings.
- All it really takes is two functions on your contract. Checkupkeep is where you provide the conditions. When these conditions evaluate true, the nodes know okay, I need to now go and send a transaction on chain.
- In terms of usage of chainlink automation, we've seen some really interesting use cases crop up over the past few years since this has been live. We've seen it used for automated governance, for gaming. There's lots and lots you can do with automation.
- In this section for creating Keeper compatible or automation compatible contracts. We've got this checkup keep function and the perform upkeep function. What we're doing in this contract is waiting a predefined period of time, some interval, and then we're increasing a counter. Shows how these automation nodes are constantly checking this contract.
- This is automation chain link. Once you get to this page, you can simply connect your wallet and we'll go through the process of registering a new upkeep against the network. Deploy contracts on Arbitram, on any other network that you'd like to come up with creative use cases.
- DeFi Edge is hosting a workshop on chainlink automation. Adesh from the Dev team will be introducing how easy it is to use. We have some enthusiastic community members asking some good questions. Stick around. We'll get to you at the very end.
- One of our team members getting married today and we just went to his wedding. We left his weding early because the workshop is something we cannot miss. Why don't you address did you want to take Alex's first question?
- In an upcoming version that we hope to launch in the very near future, we simplified the process even more so you don't necessarily have to use the UI. You can use a Solidity contract and interact directly with the registry and the registrar.
-  Asset management protocol built on top of Unisoft V Three. Anyone can create a strategy or add funds to any strategy. Also integrated chain link automation for the limit orders.
- Adesh: Chain link does the fantastic job of launching automation agent in decentralization. We created upkeep factory on top of DeFi and using that upkeep factory strategy manager can launch his own limit order contract. It's really easy to integrate and use.
- Thanks a lot guys. I want to hear more about what you're working on in detail. Now I'll share a link for the chainlink Labs discord and you can find us in the automation channel. If you want to ask some automation related questions, they're always happy to help.
- Where can everyone go to get more information on your docs and Smart contracts and everything like that? To a discord a blog. You could go here and ask the specific questions and you could get the answer in a sweet.
- Can each user have its own interval stored in a mapping or does it need to be stored in the encoded check data? There are limits to the amount of computation you can do in that checkup keep function. It's always a good practice to revalidate those conditions in that Perform Up key function.
- Are there plans to expand the products of the decentralized finance sector? And I think the answer is yes, because this is why we're here is to enable developers like yourself on Arbitrum to actually go and build those products.
- The way that we built it is behind the scenes. As soon as that checkup keep returns true, we are going to start the next phase of the pipeline which is essentially to go and get a transaction on chain. So we've built a system to be reliable and performant and we'll continue improving.
- All the work done in Checkupkeep is completely free. If you needed to reach out to an external Oracle or get some data off Chain, there's no way to do that natively. Maybe we'll broadcast the one on one combo with the that'd be fun.
- Mike: I would highly recommend the community and you guys to come and create a strategy around DeFi and set up the limit orders. I think it would be one extremely interesting experience, and I think you should give it a try. Thanks for having us.
