- This is our 46th apecoin Dow special counsel debrief presented by apecoms. It is election season and it's troll enough. We've now got three ape chain proposals live on the forum. If anybody else wants to join us on the stage, go ahead and send an invite.
- Polygon, Animoka and Mochaverse are doing their thing behind the scenes. If we could all do it together collectively somehow, I'd love to see it. Even back to backstages, maybe somehow get a little day going on it.
- Gabe: I'm always hopeful and encouraging of people and want to provide a safe space for people to have a discussion. What they often need is just a set of questions that they can prepare for. He says AIP 41 should be reverted. There needs to be a core differentiator for a gaming chain.
- On 41, it does say that apecoin would remain in Ethereum or an l two scaling solution secured by Ethereum. But it says it doesn't preclude subsequent aips from suggesting a move to another chain. There is only technically three month period for confliction with any proposal.
- My timeline is full of apecoin. Love hearing from USP. Can't wait to have these discussions. Thanks again for listening.
- There are pending proposals posted, so you can check those out as well. You could start reading, start preparing for voting for next week. Have a nice weekend everybody.
