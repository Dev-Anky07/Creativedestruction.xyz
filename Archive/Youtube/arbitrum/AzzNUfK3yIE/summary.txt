- Jordan Lyle: Today we're talking about the future of NFTs, specifically how the future is L two. His latest product is called Prohibition. Art, a long form on chain generative Art platform. Launched yesterday not even 24 hours ago.
- There are many reasons why I think NFTs are here to stay and will be a driving force moving forward. I really do think that they really do help create and maintain value in the growing crypto economy. I think there's going to be a new era where memes are authenticated and traded as digital assets.
- Prohibition Art is an open on chain, generative Art platform, and we are launching on Arbitrum. The mission is for an open and inclusive platform for Generative Art. The future of NFTs are on layer twos.
- Inclusive Edition is a generative open ended NFT series promoting inclusivity with unlimited supply and lower prices. Participation is open to all and closure is at the creator's discretion. We're releasing a project in the next few weeks that leverages this Inclusive Edition and it's going to be on prohibition.
