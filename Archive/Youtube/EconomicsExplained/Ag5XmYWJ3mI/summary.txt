- England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales collectively make up the United Kingdom. The economy is really a tale of two cities. It was the best of times and it was the worst of times. It is home to the second largest financial center in the world, but its entire economy is smaller than that of California.
- London and New York trade back and forth for the title of the world's largest financial center. The real secret to success of London as a financial centre is in the services it provides and not in the markets it accommodates.
- The United Kingdom is the world's 7th largest economy by GDP. It attracts the second highest rate of foreign investment in the world. But for the most part the economy is kind of just average for a modern developed country. This kind of British unremarkableness is actually quite a good thing.
