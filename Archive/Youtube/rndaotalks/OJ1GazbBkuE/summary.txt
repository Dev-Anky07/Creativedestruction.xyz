- Rndao's q 423 Demo Day is aimed at improving human collaboration in a variety of interesting ways. We are going to take you through presentations from each of our ventures. And then as a special bonus, given that there was so much demand this time around 160 OD, we thought a round of speed networking might be interesting.
- $8 trillion lost a year because people are miserable at work. The good news is that a lot of the fundamentals are now changing. Remote and hybrid work, the long tail of contribution with freelancing gig economies. This leads to a radical change in the way we're organizing.
- The way this is coming together is that the future is not just going alone. And it's our ability to catalyze swarms and to find these way for networks of autonomous teams. This new form of organization can take over and radically transform the way our economy and our society works.
- We start to have way more network like forms of contracting. And this changes the relationships that we have. The more relationships we have, the more complexity. We can then manage the complexity of these relationships. This allows us to have more internal complexity without being burdened down by it.
- Arendao facilitates these through a modular product ecosystem of swarm tech. We have a series of pillars around decentralized governance, legal and ownership. Financial management is an area we don't have anything yet. Very excited to look for interesting ventures and possibilities.
- We are now in an area of community powered growth. Building a community is a lot of manual work. Our solution to this problem is threefold. We address the problem of data being siloed through cross platform data analysis. And then finally, what we implemented this week is a customer support bot.
- Our solution is part of the 4.9 billion marketing tech market. We are enabling communities to grow through organic growth. Where we're heading for is a data marketplace where we provide the infrastructure of integrating and structuring data.
- And yeah, thanks for paying attention and it's time for questions. I'm inclined to move ahead and ask dad if he would mind preparing to present us with Patton. There we go. Okay, great.
- Merdad: We have different problems in the Dow communities and in the web Three industry because there isn't a specialized tool for Dows. What we came up with next was Pattern, and that was our rebrand from microflows Patterns. We strongly believe that Pattern will be the last piece of infrastructure needed organization impaired on daily basis.
-  Pattern is looking to create subdos that you can come into our ecosystem and create your own Dow. These subdos can actually be managed by some roles which we are going to use. Hopefully by the upcoming weeks or worst case scenario, the DevConnect, we would be ready to launch the product.
- Meet with Wallet is a decentralized meeting scheduling solution tailored to the needs of today's worker and their teams and communities. It lets you easily share your calendar with the press of a button. It has smart bookings built into make group collaborations much more easier.
- Parsa waiting for a question in the chat. If you're ready, do you want to share your screen and we'll listen to where you're at. The last venture for today is harmonica.
- I think decision making can be much better than it is now. And when I talk about decision making, actually I think about more specific, well, stages of that process, which is sense making and deliberation. Organizations don't do that as much as we wish they did.
- Daniel: We're building a language model powered chatbot that helps groups of people come to alignment really fast. We're also building a web dashboard which will turn simple conversations into action items and basically build a collective intelligence OS for your organization. The business model for this currently is quite simple.
- Harmony is both multiplayer and a protocol. It enables to deploy different protocols or collective intelligence protocols in your organization. With harmonica you don't need to process anything, you just generate actionable items with your team in real time.
- I have applied for my first Gitcoin grant today. If you can support us on Gitcoin, I would really appreciate that. If I have some time left, I will be happy to try to switch to the discord window and run the demo for you.
- GPT can translate any language, can understand any language venture that is currently being proposed. Currently it's sharing the same summary with everyone, but in the near future it will have separate dialogues with each participant. Will enable us to make it more effective and also cross pollinate ideas.
- The Discord link is available from the brand new website which is available at rndao info. If you have a venture idea or you want to join a venture, or you simply want to build along with R Dao, please get in touch with us.
