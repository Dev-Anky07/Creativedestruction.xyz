- GM jam: We're going to jump right into these discussions. Look, I've been making some templates for our stages. Gotten a little lazy on it over the past couple of months. One of our areas for improvement.
- There's a bit of an imposter syndrome for somebody coming into a community like ape coin Dow, which largely has perception that it's for the apes. I am really excited to get Markom's working group up and running to try and streamline the communications. Entertainment is tough no matter how you chop it.
- All right. I was almost going to ask him if he was thinking about running for Markom Stewart, but he finished it off with metaverse, so I know he's not. Thanks for coming up. Appreciate your time. Always great to hear from you.
- On a dow, there are multiple challenges in regards to fostering participation. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin foundation. If you do want to join us up on stage, please do. Love to hear from you.
- Snowflake: I was at some big events, a very huge one. Event that was in Boston was pretty big. Several banks are looking into implementing. apecoin down definitely we are one of the earthest ones. What else can we do? We're just starting.
- Apecoin dow, no spaces, no capitals, just apecoin dow sSP. It's most probably pro bono work for the first two or three months with an AIP that needs to pass in August. Keep that in mind. Love it.
