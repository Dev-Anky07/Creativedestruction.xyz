- The Challenge Protocol is internal to Arbitram. As a user, you don't really have to care about the Challenge Protocol or how it works. We want to hide this from users and keep it as something where you can assume assume that Arbitram is secure.
- The Challenge Protocol is the fraud proof implementation. It's how validators dispute assertions about l two state and prove that state to layer one. Only a single honest validator is necessary to prove the correct state. A decentralized validator set is a lot more important than a decentralized sequencer.
- Arbitram is an EVM rollup, it doesn't just do balance transfers. Reexecuting that full list of blocks might not fit in a layer one block. To fix that, we can use an interactive challenge protocol.
- All honest validators must challenge a malicious validator. Interactive challenge protocol means you can make an incorrect move and intentionally lose your challenge. New challenge protocol provides strong bounds on delay attacks, which is very important for permissionless validation.
