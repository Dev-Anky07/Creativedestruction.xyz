- GM Jam: We're going to jump right into these discussions. Look, I've been making some templates for our stages. Gotten a little lazy on it over the past couple of months. One of our areas for improvement.
- I said there's a bit of an imposter syndrome for somebody coming into a community like ape Coin Dow, which largely has perception that it's for the apes. I am really excited to get Markom's working group up and running to try and streamline the communications. Entertainment is tough no matter how you chop it.
- All right. I was almost going to ask him if he was thinking about running for Markom Stewart, but he finished it off with Metaverse, so I know he's not. Thanks for coming up. Appreciate your time. Always great to hear from you.
- On a Dow, there are multiple challenges in regards to fostering participation. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. If you have any ideas that you want to put up on the forum, would love to hear about them.
- Snowflake says crypto is not going anywhere. Several banks are looking into implementing and building on top of some of the layers that were already done. More and more users are becoming a part of Apecoin Dow and helping develop it. Snowflake says apecoin is in the early stages of innovation.
- There are actually six positions opening up. It's most probably pro bono work for the first two or three months with an AIP that needs to pass in August. If you have any questions, ask them in the comments, or join us in the discord.
