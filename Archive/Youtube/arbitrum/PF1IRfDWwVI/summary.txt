- Steven: I got 9 hours of sleep last night. Ed: Fantastic. Rested. Love it. Still have a ways to go. Here comes Harry.
- Today we're going to be talking with the founders about Arbitram orbit. You may have read about it briefly in the docs on medium, but we're here to dive a little bit deeper into it. Would love to start with some introductions.
- Edmondson: The story goes back to 2014 when I was a professor at Princeton. He says a group of undergraduates built an early version of Arbitram. It took a long time of figuring out, improving and improving until the first version was released in 2021. There's also a White House AMA, a different type of governance.
- The launch of Arbitrum One was in the end of August of 2021. The biggest story for Arbitrum, obviously, is the launch of community governance, which we just announced yesterday. That's really arguably the biggest milestone in this whole history.
- Arbitrum is the first roll up or the first EVM roll up to have on chain self executing governance. The vote on chain actually has the governance power. The Arbitrum ecosystem has always been tech first. As the Arbitram Foundation takes over, those core values will remain.
- Arbitrum Orbit makes it easy and permissionless for anyone to build a layer three chain on top of one of the Arbitram L two S. The community has the decision making power to grant additional layer two licenses of Ethereum. Put this power in the hands of the community.
- An L Three is a new way to build a chain on top of L Two. The code base is available to be freely modified for the purposes of L Three S. The only caveat is that building an L three is not simple.
- There are some themes that I've seen where certain teams are interested in having their own chains, their own layer threes in particular. A successful project can build their own chain that's completely open. Every L three chain has the same capacity as the Arbitram layer twos itself.
- Orbit is putting the tools in the hands of developers that they can make these decisions. They can analyze their own business goals and make the decision to launch their own layer three with the best technology available. All of these tools will be available to them.
- As a research guy, I'm actually really excited about what people will be be able to do with L Three chains via Orbit in terms of research. You can modify it because Orbit gives you the right to modify the Nitro stack of Arbitram. And you can do that permissionlessly and by using Orbit.
- The sky's the limit here. You can launch an L Three chain that has the exact same permissions as the Arbitram public chains. But you can also launch an l three chain that says, hey, only these keys or these particular addresses can deploy contracts. It's really up to the developers to decide how open or not open they would want to make their L three chains.
- Arbitram One and Nova have their security anchored in ethereum. This way, of course, anyone can go off and make their own layer one chain. But you don't get the security that you would get by building within the ethereum based stack.
- There are projects that we're aware of that have told us about their intentions to build an orbit chain. My understanding in the next week or two, the first one of these that I know about will make their plans public. By the nature of the technology being open and permissionless to launch layer three chains that we will learn just with the rest of the world.
- Arbitram Stylus is the next gen upgrade that's coming to the Arbitram stack. Will allow developers to write their code not only in EVM languages like Solidity, but also in Rust, C and C Plus. Will be available later this year, but it's up to Arbitram Dao whether or not to include it in public chains.
- This really opens the door for a Cambrian explosion of all kinds of different things that people can build. What I'm guess most excited about is the innovation that this will enable and also the community participation. The Arbitrage AirDrop will be live next week on Thursday.
- There were already over 160 applications from people to become delegates of the system. Why is there a one week delay between the Arbitram announcement of the Token and Arbitram Token launch? The point of this week delay is to give the opportunity for community members.
