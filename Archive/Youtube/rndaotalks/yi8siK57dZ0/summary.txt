- First learned Q Basic in 1995, so I've sort of been Dabbling ever since. I studied philosophy of science. Then I did a PhD in communication. Now I'm an Assistant Professor of management in London.
- How do collective decisions happen? I'm going to focus on three different types of collective decisions. They're all going to be related in many ways. I'm working with a couple of folks here to develop an AI Bot to facilitate group decision making. I am more than happy to follow up with further in depth conversations.
- A case study we give to our MBA students to actually negotiate when we teach negotiations. It's a classic kind of multiparty, multi issue negotiation. You have to get at least five out of six have to vote yes on whatever the deal is. Here's how to map the entire negotiation.
- Sylvio: How do you quantify the decision tree to create the vector from and then how do you export that into a vector store to extrapolate the insights? Nelson: It allows you to convert subjective preferences into quantifiable payoffs. This is an ongoing project.
- How does the group find the solution that everybody will say yes on? That's my theoretical question. How does multi party, multi issue negotiation happen? Here's my behavioral model for how people negotiate.
- This project is about the intersection of negotiation and group problem solving. Maybe we could have a little bit like AI agent that would listen to the conversation, know the topic, and propose solutions to a group. This is really basic research aimed at quite a few possibilities for interventions.
- All beliefs are forecasts. How can we get really accurate forecasts? There's this property known as the wisdom of crowds. We can use theoretical models to start forming hypotheses.
- Decentralized networks will preserve the wisdom of crowds when people talk, centralized networks will lose the wisdom. The effect of communication is driven not only by the network structure, but by confidence accuracy correlation. Communication can lead to social herding.
- The actual decision itself is decoupled from that wisdom of crowds metrics. The vote on yes no, are they above or below a four can get less accurate. You have to be really careful in theorizing and thinking about every stage of the decision process.
- This is a model we use for explaining the emergence of conventions. Things like language, we don't care what word we use, as long as we use the same word. Why don't we converge on the best possible outcomes? This is a question of network centralization.
- Those are my three vignettes. I'm happy to stick around for we have at least two minutes if people have further discussion. So, yeah, we definitely want to open the door for Q A. Really, really excellent presentation, Joshua.
- You mentioned that depending on a deliberation, the truth could either be skewed in the opposite direction or toward the truth. One thing to look at for a group is that confidence calibration and talkativeness. It's pretty unpredictable whether Deliberation is going to help or harm.
- In terms of being centralized and decentralized, is there something as an optimum moment, an optimum timing of it? Maybe it's about being centralized in some ways while being decentralized in other ways. The real challenge as an engineer, I treat management as an engineering.
- So I'm really interested in how the structure of the choices, the choice structure, is impacting the quality of all of those things. Depends on whether I'm wearing my practitioner hat or my scientist hat. If you have a complex problem that's going to require a very different style of facilitation than a simple problem.
- Do you believe there is a risk for only safer decisions passing stunting, the more creative? Different processes can lead to different preferences. Whether your group goes for one or the other is going to depend a little bit on their preferences.
