- Katman Yalek is hosting a startup panel on getting into product. We have three PMS with us today, and we'll be joined also by YC alumni Helena Merck. After the panel, each panelist will be in separate session rooms where you can meet them and ask them more questions.
- Sylvia is currently a PM at Brex, leading our identity team, which owns everything onboarding. Prior to this, she was at Facebook for quite a stint. Before Facebook, she spent a few years at workday as a product manager. All right, colleague, you want to go next?
- I'm colleague Borkowski. I am a PM at Burbix, which is a Y combinator company. Before that, I was a journalist in DC. Where I covered the Supreme Court. Wow. Very timely.
- Helena, do you want to go next? Yeah, I'd love to. I love both your background, just kind of a cool story and how you got to PM. I'm very excited to learn from both of you in how to get more into product.
- What is the product manager's role in an organization, and what are your key responsibilities at your current company? And then we can talk a little bit about how that has changed depending on where you're working or what type of company you're focused on.
- The biggest difference between larger companies like Facebook and workday is around the scope. At Facebook, the strategy at a high level has already been predefined. At Brux, where we are trying to solve some very complex problems, we don't have a single defined way of doing things.
- Kali is the first PM at Burbix. Can you talk about what the role of a know is and how that perhaps is different from working with other PMS in a team? I think of product really as like the editor in a lot of ways of like how do we create focus.
- How do you think about products as an early stage founder? There is definitely no playbook and it's definitely not ironed out so very much in that iterative MVP stage. Part of why I love the early stages of a startup.
- Vile Chang is a product manager at Airbnb, focused on data products. He started his career as a software engineer and then went to managing engineering teams. His first role in the data space was as a data engineer. Now he straddles the role across all of those.
- The former Know and Lyft PM talks about his new role at Airbnb. Says working at a larger company, you take a lot for granted. Learning to manage all the emergencies and the fires has been very interesting.
- What are some of the most common misperceptions of what a PM does? Basically, what does a PM not do? Your job is more to make sure that everyone else is bought into that before you can actually get anything done.
- There is no single framework to building successful product or being a successful PM. It's a toolbox and you learn, but specifically around driving alignment. A common misperception is a PM is like a project manager. From a PMI actually does everything and it really depends on the situation.
- Helena, when you are as a founder, your own PM, how do you prioritize feature requests, requests from your users to develop your roadmap?
- What would you say are the crucial skills to becoming a successful PM? I think one of the most important things is just being able to tell a story. Natural curiosity just helps with the whole vision and strategy aspect of product.
- Do you also have to be a good writer? It also does depend on the communication style that your team or company has. There's no such thing as the perfect PM. Find opportunities that will fit with your strengths.
- The execution piece, I think, is the one that can be trained the most. The product sense, the vision and strategy, that is definitely very experience driven. And that's where I actually think curiosity helps a lot.
- How do you define or measure success of a product manager and how has that changed from being an engineer in your past roles? For us, it comes down to how quickly can we get new products out. Another measure of success is also are you able to do so while essentially maintaining a healthy team dynamic.
- What would you say is the biggest challenge of being a PM day to day? I think one of the hardest things to do is to prove that you're actually providing value. A lot of what we do is more strategy based.
- Helena: Another thing that comes to mind for me is probably prioritization of my own time. It's around understanding what is urgent and impactful to figure out now versus what can wait or maybe be delegated. How to measure productivity as a PM is something I'm still kind of figuring out myself.
- For me, I get to participate in all parts of the product development lifecycle. It keeps things interesting and I'm never bored, for better or for worse. There's just an inherent satisfaction in bringing order to chaos. Wearing all the hats is definitely what drew me to be a founder.
- How do you figure out if a startup or product is going to be right for you as a PM? It depends on who you are as a person and what you care about. Are you looking for a slightly more established culture or a Wild West environment?
- Lean asks about what's the best way to prepare for a PM interview. A lot of it is just thinking on the fly because you never know what you're going to be asked. It's so much more about the delivery and whether you can structure and articulate your plan.
- In what ways did your technical background prepare you for PM roles? If you're not from a technical background, can you still break into product management? Have there been any big setbacks that you've experienced in your career?
- As a woman, you actually have to repeat it like 50 times before people actually get it. There's just unconscious bias there where you're not as credible. The broader theme is just knowing your worth, right, and having confidence.
- Sticking with your routine and making sure that you have those things to help you reset or refresh and re energize are extremely important. Another thing that I found really useful is this idea of kind of like a pyramid. Self care is very important.
- All right, thank you to the four of you who spent your time talking and sharing their stories with us today. And if you're interested in open PM positions at YC startups, you can always check out workatostarup. com. It was super enjoyable and I learned so much from you guys.
