- Edwin Jensen has kindly accepted to share a little bit about the Tlos. I joined Rndao a week ago. It's been fun already, engaging with a few different people. I'm really excited to talk about this.
- Edwin Janssen: When I read Reinventing Organizations, it completely changed my paradigm for how we could be more successful as organizations. He says his company, Ian Martin Group, changed from a profit-driven staffing company to a purpose first social enterprise. Jantssen: Is it actually more successful? Does it make business sense?
- I have the role of corporate development. Fancy way of saying what is our future strategy? And actually we've decided to make all hiring consent based because we're a people organization. Could you tell us a little bit about how does that process work of starting new businesses and especially funding around these new businesses.
- The advice process simply is kind of anyone can make any decision provided you use the advice process. By contrast, the consent based process is a proposal based process. Different companies have different degrees of transparency as to how you're incorporating your advice and then making your decision.
- Pablo: Could you go through your tech stack tool stack on how you make all this work? Is it just Lumio or are you combining some other tools? Pablo: I think it's very important to have some kind of Teal. org tool. That would just make life easier for everyone.
- Do you have the budgeting processes? Are those sort of on a rolling basis through the consent process? Or do you have some sort of cohort or cyclical budgeting where you compare things? That's an area I think that we can improve on.
- Budget is more like we have this base business, let's go to all the business units. And then we manage investments, net new investments via consent processes and proposals as we're going along. Owner turned company into a B Corp. and gave profits to employees via profit sharing.
- How do you create the psychological safety where non anonymous decisions can feel comfortable for the group? Safety is the foundational thing or one of the foundational things for the Teal operating system to be successful. How you receive this feedback?
- SBI is a way for people, when they're emotionally triggered and could give feedback in such a way that it might decrease psychological safety. The key for psychological safety, in my opinion, is helping people to better communicate.
- In a 500 person organization, how often does that happen? We don't track it. The longer that it goes without the Sbitir, often the worse it gets. This is the final frontier in Teal. How do we help people communicate with each other?
- Edwin: I'm very curious how your recruitment onboarding process works with that. It's like how people really adopt Teal. The work is 90% the same, but the paradigm, the container is very different. How does it work to bring people into these?
- In your first three months, you get assigned a sponsor, a teal sponsor that's just helping you to practice the practices. Practice giving feedback. Practice receiving feedback. At the end of the three month period, you graduate.
- There are some beliefs behind the Teal operating system. Senior leaders in our organization still are not through the heart phase after five years. Something that I think could be valuable is to somehow codify what are all these beliefs.
- Everyone has work trauma from the past, right? Or from school even. And these things are often triggered. Is there a perspective on if the organization has a responsibility to help folk work through these triggers when you're leaving the organization?
