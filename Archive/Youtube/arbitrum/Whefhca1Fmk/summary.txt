- Stylus is a next gen programming environment for Arbitrum chains that's coming out this year. What it essentially lets you play smart contracts written in Rust, C, C plus plus and more. If the goal is to scale to the next billion users, we're going to need to scale the next million devs.
- Stylus uses two virtual machines: the Ethereum virtual machine and WebAssembly. A contract in one language can call another and there's absolutely no difference. They both commit results the same way, they both access same data structures and storage. And we have found a way to bring it to the blockchain on L Two.
- Since we're talking about computation being so cheap in the Stylus world, something like cryptography becomes possible in a way that's currently infeasible on most EVM chains. And that opens up use cases too in gaming and AI.
- Rust has a really efficient way of doing gas that ensures the safety of this system. In the WASM model, everything is structured, and what that means is we're able to perform static analysis. And when you have that, you get called sandboxing.
- Stylus is a natural extension of the WASM technologies that we've already built. Now that we can actually instrument wasms and do that gas stuff that you saw, we're able to actually fraud proof them directly. These aren't like MVP fraud proofs. They're complete.
- By the end of this year, we will have stylus. The other thing is we're going to have a testnet very soon. To be able to actually test it and use it and port your DAPs over. This stuff will be coming out this year.
