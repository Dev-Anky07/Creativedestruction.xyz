- GM Jam: We're going to jump right into these discussions. Look, I've been making some templates for our stages. Gotten a little lazy on it over the past couple of months. So many recent events, so many discussions.
- SSP: Thanks for hacking the algorithm with us. As we work toward getting eyes on these spaces, which is not for any kind of personal glory. This is for us to get eyes on the Dow and therefore to increase the voting and participation.
- We got the twins here. Twelve gauge. Now we got bad teeth. If you guys could just maybe buy one heavy metal with, like, a crazy face and just call it twelve teeth. Having fun.
- Hoddler: Are you saying that the algorithm rewards more people on stage or rewards the activity of getting on stage, jumping down. Even just jumping up the first time, and if you jump off later, if you come up, ask a question, pop off, it's cool.
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday is an informal meeting of the Apecoin community. The group tries to go deeper into conversations. Everything they discuss is their personal opinion and not representative of the foundation.
- As far as recent events in the ecosystem, I don't know that we want to talk about it. We can't even in this community decide what an open edition or a timed edition is. There are so many of these discussions going on right now, but I'm going to move on from that.
- Where is Apecoin Dow in all of these discussions? Is that fair? Should we be in everything? I don't necessarily think so. I think we should still be targeting and making sure that we're connected to the right communities.
- Go to where your passion is. We need those Apecoin Dow salesmen out on these stages. This is a safe space, great practice ground. If you've never spoken on the stages before, this is the place to do it.
- LFG: I would love to have more of us in the apecoin community especially. He says guys like Lost and Mocha Chief G are inspiring people like him. LFG: Love community Fridays. Take care.
- Chris: I love to get to know what's going on with the Apecoin Dow. I think what Dows are doing will end up influencing how NFT projects will be set up in the future. SSP: Apecoms is like a starter stage. You can get your chops up. Ask your questions, get your ideas on the table.
- Annie: I just wanted to express my love and respect for you guys. You do this so many times and really engage with the community. It's so easy to get the community active and engaged during a bull market. But during a bear market, it's so hard to get a community involved and engaged.
- Annie: My Ape is currently under the administrative review, so it's not even up for vote yet. And then I will start working on a bunch of more designs. Let's hope it will go up for a vote soon. I love it.
- AIP 289 designing a mascot for Apecoin. Not up for vote. It's an administrative review. If you guys want to read it, check it out. This is Annie.
- There's a few things to talk about about marketing, communications. It would be great to have folks like Annie and what she's trying to do as part of the marketing communications working group. Community feedback is good. Stay strong to your design principles.
- We got both of our community discord facilitators up here. If you guys need any help ever, feel free to DM us, message us. Things are not always super smooth with joining on the discourse platform. But if you guys have any issues, any problems, please do feel free.
- The Apecoin Dow is looking for a steward for the Marketing and Communications Working Group. Would you leave a pretty decent paying job to put up a proposal that may or may not pass? The heavy lifting now really begins and we need to attract the right talent.
- Mark Hom's and Metaverse working group charter authors. If anybody has any questions, comments, concerns, please join us on the stage. Get your questions in bad Teeth.
- We need the right people doing the right roles in these working groups. But we're faced with this challenge of system, which essentially is electing people. Some way we have to come up with a mechanism in the Dow. Focus groups are forming. If you have an idea for a focus group, start it up right now.
- Apecoin Dow is a potential opportunity for builders, artists, creators, developers, et cetera. Do you think you're coming across as excited when you're doing a pitch? I bring as much positive energy as I can. But I also caveat it.
- Last Plutocracy has been around for a year and a half. Why are we not empowering our community to build cool stuff? That's the thing that always drives me crazy. I think that we can probably get some stuff done that makes a difference.
- In August, we are going to be coming up with three or four AIPS for the Governance, possibly the treasury, the Metaverse, and the Marketing Communications Working Group. There will be a four to $10 million ask, maybe milestoned to make it more digestible. Early and often is important here.
- We had AIP 279, AIP 280 approved in the affirmative last week. Tons of votes came in for not only this proposal, but in general. Last week we had nine to 10 million votes on proposals. These delegations are starting to pop up.
- SSP: Are we excited about the creative ideas being approved by the Dow? 100%? It was strategic on Ramon's part just to ask the 300,000, because he read the room. At the end of the day, I think what I'd mentioned to Ramon and Dubious G and others in basically trying to disrupt Hollywood. That's done by a collective, not individuals.
- There's a bit of an imposter syndrome for somebody coming into a community like ape coin dow which largely has perception that it's for the apes. I am really excited to get Markom's working group up and running to try and streamline the communications. Thanks everybody.
- Ben: On a dow, there are multiple challenges in regards to fostering participation. If you have any ideas that you want to put up on the forum would love to hear about them. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin Foundation.
- Snowflake: crypto is not going anywhere. Several banks are looking into, implementing and building on top of some of the layers that were already done. We have more and more users to becoming a part of apecoin dow and helping develop it. We're in the beginning.
- Forks and pitches. Showed up. If you go at current rate, you're looking at 81 grand additional per month. You can either just say at 81,000 additional or spread it out over a year. Go full hog, go.
- Ape Assembly or where are we going with sort of these elections? What are you thinking as the author in the current state of the Ape assembly? I suggest to everybody listening that temper your expectations of what a marketing communications group is going to do.
- The next assembly that will be temporal during the summer plus and will be not paid. The way we will vote on those free assembly people is kind of like gradual voting. We really have only people who are really interested all through.
- Buckets: I was just finding the best way to really push this forward. It's essentially asking for a one time use just like the Apecoin logo, brand assets. I think it hits all the marks of a successful AIP idea. I love it.
-  OD Labs is a lifestyle brand that incorporates XR mixed reality in its clothing. The company is looking for approval to use the Apecoin Dow logo and name. There's a proposal up right now that actually will allow rev share.
- Buckets: We're not set up right now for bringing money revenues back into the Dow. We're right now actually working on a way of actually accepting Apecoin as a payment. It's not about making money, it's about mostly covering our own costs.
- Could the Dow set up almost a separate treasury that is not for the Dao itself, but to be funneled into other projects asking for funds from the Dow in the future? It's not about giving back to the DaaS, but nothing to do with it.
- The idea is to create a similar hoodie, Apecoin Dow themed. The issue is more about their relationship with shopify and accepting Ape. But there's a lot of little details you have to get right.
- 1537: Is this an ordinal ape without an orange background or what's going on here? What is this? Good afternoon, fellas. I like your new concept, bro. Initiation movement. It has to start somewhere. I love it. I just can't wait for the new hoodie.
- "I would love that coin to be used over here. It has so much potential over here " If I see a bit ape coin, I'm coming after you, though.
- Archdu. G. wants to talk about what else the Mochaverse community is doing. If you guys just get you at least one ape coin, that's all you need. Ask some questions to ask in these spaces and get the people who you want to give sway to.
- Yatsu definitely making his splash across the world, I guess. Seems like he's planning to do more as the board Apiacla goes sort of across Asia. We may not do the Wednesday space and that's still in discussion. Things are nascent and we shall define them.
- GM: Japan can appear to be slow to change, but when it moves, it moves as one. The way things work over there, it is very much one. So we can expect it to be crypto, like, overnight.
- G: My whole calendar is very booked to the web free samit with the Animoka Japan office and other people around the crypto space. If you guys have not booked your flights or your tickets yet because you're listening to Yuga and you're waiting for those announcements. Get some free booking in.
- The key is we need to get our facts straight when we go out there into other spaces to talk about the Apecoin Dow. At the end of the day, marketing Communications passed. Now the working group is what weneed to put together and that's the heavy lift.
- The board congratulates Marketing and Communication Walking Group. "That's a huge step for us and I'm excited for what will become," says Mr. Hype. Ellen, you got an orange background. It's a bitcoin ordinal ape.
- Alan from Holland is a member of the Apecoin Dow community. He says it's in the community's DNA to learn and to teach people. You just need one apecoin to join this community.
- Currently in our community, we are building our own dao. And I also want to mention that we also will have our own coins as bid apes. ERC, 20 tokens and BRC 20 tokens. If you want to know more about ordinals, just come in our spaces.
- Apecoin will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for community led initiatives. Drive culture forward into the metaverse. Let's build together. That's what we're all about.
- We got blockchain ninja up here. The project that I was on, the Mint stalled, so I'm not getting paid next week, apparently. So I need to find a way to make some ETH ASAP. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to message me.
- The Metaverse Working Group is approved and moving towards electing stewards. We do these Monday, Wednesday and Friday at noon PST. Friday is our community hour, where we invite anybody up to the stage. Sometimes we put a clickbait title in.
- There are actually six positions opening up. Each of those working groups is going to need three stewards. It's most probably pro bono work for the first two or three months with an AIP that needs to pass in August.
