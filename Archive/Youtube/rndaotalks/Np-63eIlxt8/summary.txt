- Lee Bryant is an educator and co founder at Postshift, which is startup that helps organizations introduce agile capabilities. Lee, why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself?
- Lee Bryant: I've been involved in social and digital technology within organizations for quite a while. He says his first career was really in politics and activism. Bryant says he's fascinated by DAOs but skeptical about their interaction with human nature.
- We have really an institutional design problem, not just in companies, but also in government organizations. In NGOs, we have organizational models that are fundamentally unfit for purpose in a time of rapid change. The question is can we try and coordinate work without the costly analog management system sitting on top?
- Companies need agile, adaptive attributes, tight feedback loops, learning structures. But also evolution depends on having great predators, fierce competition, and an openness to the rest of the ecosystem. If we want to design a modern organizational operating system, decentralization must be an absolutely key feature.
- The idea of dao is intriguing, and perhaps this is the route to decentralized organizations. We have the potential to give people incredible organizational superpowers using modern tools and technology. But we should use these tools to augment human intelligence and activity, not to replace it.
- The power of small teams is immense today. All of the best examples of innovation tend to come from small multidisciplinary teams about the size of an army squad. A switch from hierarchy, vertically divided systems to laterally connected platforms and networks is a viable base for decentralized systems.
- Many organizations just work by consensus, which is a very hard and difficult and slow way of running an organization. Some are moving to a more consent based within certain risk frameworks. There are probably ten or twelve commonly used decision making methods which apply to different cases. We need to understand how risk modeling and decision making changes in this exponential age.
- Employees are the customers of the organization first and foremost. If we can create meaningful, rewarding, autonomous, and sort of decentralized experiences for them, then maybe we can get some of the most talented people back into organizations. So I wouldn't give up on big old organizations quite yet.
- Leaders of organizations should actively be doing to have their organization more agile and continuously adapt to challenges. The way that many of them work today is so fabulously wasteful in terms of both time and money. You have to also then empower or inspire the emerging leaders to take some power.
- There's an emerging concept right now in a lot of companies right now called Total experience. It's really involved with seeing how the experience of the actual employees are that state. One of the lessons is around this total experience idea that your first customer is your team. Focus on them, and only after that.
- Lee: My current work is focused on collaborative hybrid intelligence emerging from the human and AI agents in networked teams. If we can stop being obsessed with giving will and personality to these bots and just let them do basic tasks, then I think we can advance very quickly in that field.
- Lee: Do you think it's possible to give this skin in the game without making things transactional. A middle ground is something which is more around reputation. I'd like to see a system where if you're going to vote, you maybe need to do a civics class.
- Excellent, excellent. Great question, very interesting response. Looks like we have two more questions. Please introduce yourself and go ahead and ask your question.
- Ryan Lavelle is the founder of Empower. Empower's mission to create sort of an exponential scale organization to democratize, impact investing in disruptive clean technology projects. We're about to actually start building some things in the blockchain space finally.
- Do we feel that this conversation about democratization and decentralized governance is kind of no longer a sort of science project theory? I think we are a bit of an inflection point in that. I like to start small and then work on the integration and the scaling.
- Daniel: One thing that is being very actively negotiated is the idea of permissionless joining that also relates with transparency. On the other side it has also opened the door for a bunch of people who would have never made it past the traditional gates to participate here. And it has been able to discover a lot of talent.
- A community is something that takes a long time to join, to be accepted in, to develop a reputation in. reputation in a group is also conditional on context. Friction is good in terms of communities because it's a filtering mechanism. But we need to recreate some of the frictions and limitations of the real world.
