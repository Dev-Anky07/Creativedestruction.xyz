- Today we're so excited to host Chair Lena Khan of the Federal Trade Commission. Luther Lowe is the new head of public policy at Y Combinator. We want to be the voice of founders in Washington. There'll be plenty of time for Q A.
- There's a history of antitrust and anti monopoly regulation actually leading to a lot more innovation. From the perspective of antitrust enforcement, enforcing the laws of fair competition has actually been really critical. There are a whole bunch of lawsuits underway right now.
- Y Combinator co-founder: We are a friend to entrepreneurs and founders. The goal of the antitrust laws is to make sure we have open, fair, competitive markets so that people can get a fair shake. He says he doesn't think the startup world is asking for anything more than a fair playing field.
- One of the things under your Purview is commenting or regulating acquisitions. Is there some aspect of blocking acquisitions know would actually help Little Tech? Having more competition among acquirers is ultimately going to be better for the startup.
- Is it possible for these acquisitions to get some sort of private approval through the government? Each country has its own laws and regulations. Deals can affect different countries differently. We are thinking about what else can we do to provide more clarity and certainty in the market.
- FTC's role, as you noted, is really about competition. Can you talk about how you view competition in the AI space? What are the bottlenecks and what role do you see for open source in this discussion?
- DCU should be engaging directly with founders, with startups, says Cheer Khan. Who here is a brave first volunteer to come up and ask a question, please?
- The question I wanted to ask was about the FTC and venture capitalists. A question often put to us when we raise money is how are you going to build moats. I'm curious of your thoughts on what it means when VCs ask that. And what you think the nexus between the venture capital world and the FTC should be.
- If VCs are dead set on exit by acquisition by one of the big guys, what does that do in terms of potentially distorting or short circuiting the innovation trajectory that we should be seeing? Having more competition would make sure that that's getting addressed too.
- Jerry Khan: It's not really clear reading the EO, exactly how some of that applies to open source systems. What is the FTC's perspective on the applied use of those fine tuned models? If a company decides to start training a new model, at what point does it become subject to government review?
- In digital markets, we've seen what's been called the kind of open first, closed later strategy. Is it actually possible for all of us here to contribute engineering time to train an actual open source model that is in direct competition with the big ones? There is no clarity on that.
- Some of the most innovative papers that we've seen have come out of monopoly companies research labs. There is a real risk that if they lose that status, they stop being able to fund research that could be extremely valuable to both open source communities and founders. FTC's job is to enforce the antitrust laws.
- One of the biggest criticisms of regulators is that they're fighting yesterday's battle. How do you make sure the big players are going to dominate the next generative AI shift? I'm here to be hearing from and meeting with founders and startups and little tech.
- FTC is tracking more pervasive price coordination through software. There has been a whole bunch of reporting, including in the real estate space, noting how there's software that may be allowing that coordination. Do you think the government has the adequate tools to deal with these types of anti competitive behavior?
- Are there other structural or governance based regulations that you're considering to ensure there's less extraction and more value creation for consumers? Historically there have been a set of regulatory paradigms that have had a seat at the table.
- My question is on alliances and even investments. For example, is a HyperCloud investing in an independent AI company? Is that really about competition or is that about capturing spend back to the hyperclouds? It's something that we're thinking about and I think is very timely right now.
- The FTC is the de facto privacy enforcer in the United States in the absence of some type of kind of separate federal privacy law. The shift to LLMs and AI could create another set of incentives to be endlessly vacuuming up people's data. We're going to continue enforcing the laws.
- FTC has a long bipartisan tradition of building up its international engagement program. There are a lot know agreements in place with other enforcers to be able to share information. But there are limits on how much we can coordinate because every country has its own laws.
