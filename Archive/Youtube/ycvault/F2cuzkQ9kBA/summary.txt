- Jordan: I helped start Compound a few years ago because I didn't understand my personal finances. He wanted kind of a wealth management product specifically designed for people who work in the technology world. Compound is an all in one financial management solution for startup founders, employees and investors.
- Today we're going to talk about startup equity compensation. My real goals for this conversation are first and foremost, to get you to care about your equity. If you could pay attention for the next 30 minutes or so, you will leave with an increased odds of achieving your goals in the future.
- You can save 20% to 40% of the value of your work by thinking about the taxes. The single most important thing you can do is pick the right place to spend your time. Equity at the end of the day is just like an investment.
- We're going to dive into equity and you may have read some about it before. It's this weird thing that you don't know how to necessarily represent on your balance sheet. It is up to you and is your responsibility to figure out some of the key information associated with your equity.
-  grants and stock options give you the right to purchase shares in your company. The strike price is equal to the valuation at the time you joined the company. There are tax implications for exercising your stock options.
- Jordan: Figure out what your post termination exercise window is. Some companies extend their exercise window beyond 90 days to something like three years or five years. What happens if a company doesn't disclose information such as the number of fully diluted shares outstanding?
- There are two types of stock options. ISOs and NSOs have different tax implications. More companies are offering extended exercise windows. It's important to weigh the pros and cons because the reality is there's no right answer.
- Jordan: Is the equity amount ever something you would negotiate? How do you think about generally approaching a negotiation and finding the right amount based on your job and role? All the companies are different. You want to find a fair compromise that works for both sides.
- There are differences from a tax perspective and from a liquidity perspective. For restricted stock units RSUs, you don't have to exercise them. But options give you more optionality to acquire shares outright. It's far more of a company wide administrative change to move between options and RSUs.
- How can employees today think about selling maybe to investors in an upcoming round or navigate that question? Some companies offer regular liquidity events. There are brokers and exchanges that specialize in secondary markets. I encourage you to explore what's out there if you are looking for liquidity in your company.
- In your offer letter, it's actually not going to tell you the strike price often depending on the size of the company. The strike price, remember, is according to the latest foreign and evaluation. Sometimes people get upset when they don't get what they were promised.
- Our goal is to help people with their finances, really specifically, all these startup specific needs. So things like exercising options, investing your money away from an IPO, borrowing money. We've written about it at length as well. Both you it's been really helpful.
- My question is just digging a bit more into the companies which allow you to sell your options pre IPO. How common is it for a company to go all the way to IPO without allowing liquidity for all their normal employees?
- Early exercising is a concept where your company gives you the ability to exercise all of your stock options before they vest. What that allows you to do is prepay all my taxes up front for my exercising of my options. So you won't owe any taxes potentially at the time of exercise.
- My encouragement to people is just in general, keep it simple. Don't innovate, right, just do the boring things for the most. Make sure you build a strategy where you're happy in both of those worlds.
- Jordan: Could you talk quickly about stock option financing and options to acquire liquidity to exercise your options? Jordan: There are funds out there that will give you a loan to exercised your options. They're called non recourse loans or private financing contracts. Find a lawyer who specializes in this sort of stuff.
- Some companies have a refresher grant program. In general, my view is you should totally negotiate and try to get more equity and more exposure over time. My suggestion for all of you is to become friends with those people.
- We are hiring across the board right now. We are hiring software engineers especially. We care deeply about writing and quality and going to the weed. You can send us an email directly. Also happy to be useful to anyone if they're looking for a job.
- Robert: I was just curious about the norms around creating a compensation package for co founders. The purpose of compensation is to incentivize people to build a long term, enduring business. For most startups, that's just a four year vesting period.
- When you're thinking about negotiating and sharing equity compensation, do you compare yourself to people in similar positions at your company? Can you form a union against your company to kind of negotiate people?
