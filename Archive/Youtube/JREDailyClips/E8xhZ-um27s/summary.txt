- Gambling is a real problem for some people, but I support it because I feel like you need to have control over your life. If gambling is stopping you from having control of your life, don't make gambling illegal. Get your life in order.
- The same thing in the mind that gets you obsessed with your next high or your next wild thing could also transfer to accomplishing personal goals. Starting a business, being obsessed with the business, you can do it in a positive way with that same mindset.
