- 90 Nick is a Dao mechanism designer and also been a governance facilitator. Has been very interested in the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. Will share some of his research and thinking in this space with us today.
- An old idea that's coming to life now in Dows from Mir Dan Cohen back in 1986. The idea was an ownerless and artificially intelligent organization that would repurchase all of its outstanding shares and govern itself. Why does it matter? What's the point of caring about AI and DAOs?
- Three topic areas I want to share today are about agent based modeling for Dows. The second one is Automation in what I'm calling Microservice Dows, and then the third one is interfaces for AI. I share all of this in the spirit of open source collaboration.
- The first concept is agent based modeling for Dows. Agent based models are used as ways of simulating networks of people organizations. Very interesting, surprising behaviors can come out of very simple sets of rules.
- The incentive alignment for a microservice dow to basically create automation. Service dows are a great on ramp. I think my hypothesis is that entire microservice dows will eventually become automated. Does anyone have any questions or things they'd like to discuss?
- Why should a microservice dow decentralize? And will they? I think that decentralization from an Ethos perspective as well as from an economic perspective, could be motivated by market forces. But for me, the exit to community is probably still very early stage.
- There's a scarcity of human ingenuity that is interested in solving a problem that's already solved. Creating these types of automations is like the highest leverage activity that we can do. The tokenization and the decentralization improves the network effects of the microservice dow. That would be a strong incentive to decentralize.
- The third section is where are the areas that AI might create value in dows. The actual making of proposals, this is kind of a collective sense making idea. We're seeing like an explosion of governance experiments in the space right now. Agent based modeling simulations could help us do that more effectively.
- I often think about things in DAOs on the scale from humanistic to mechanistic. Compensation will become increasingly mechanistic, especially in the largest and most permissionless DAOs. Will decentralization help support the danger of automating some of these things?
- Algorithm can be manipulated maybe or tricked into doing stuff that they shouldn't do. This, I think, poses a risk of AI safety, like you said. Building resilience to that is going to be super important.
- Nick: I would love to hear more about what AI interfaces or ways that AIS can create value. Can I propose something? If we do a zoom poll voting right now with all the twelve ideas that you have here and we all vote, try to get a ranking out of them.
- Nick: The highest leverage activity that I think we can be doing right now is to do mechanism design. I'm really excited to see where the future of organization lies when we have this open source coordination with composable mechanisms that are fundamentally decentralized. We still have three minutes.
- When you talk about mechanism design, you mean for the mechanism design of the global dow. The reason I'm building that is because I think as a primitive, it's one of the most impactful ratchets to support the development of more coordination power in. And I think that we'll see the Bottoms Up emergent complexity from these simple mechanisms.
- Nick would you be OK with sharing the slides? Sure, happy to. Can I just drop the link in the chat? Awesome. If anyone wants to continue a conversation, we're also there. This has been really interesting. Loads of food for thought.
