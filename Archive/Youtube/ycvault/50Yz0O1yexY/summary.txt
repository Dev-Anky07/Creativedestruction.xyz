- Multiverse is making next generation tabletop RPGs. You can stream, you play with your friends. And we're building a marketplace because DND and tabletop RPGs are ultimately about telling your own story. We want anyone to be able to make content on Multiverse, but we're also the first creators on it.
- Games, I think, sometimes make people a little bit uncomfortable in tech because they're different. In entertainment, you really need to have a point of view that you're sharing and you need it to be compelling. Not every gaming startup is an entertainment company, right?
- Sarah is the creative director and co founder at Multiverse and primarily the Illustrator. She believes that artists have the same skill sets that you expect of good tech founders. When you start introducing just one Illustrator to your team, you have access to many more.
