[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:16.000 ] Speaker A : Rand Paul. I don't know if you saw one of these moments. Yeah, Rand Paul versus Fauci moments. And he said that they found out through a Freedom, Freedom of Information act that it was something like $135,000,000 in royalties had been paid out to scientists on the NIH, at the NIH from pharmaceutical companies.
[ 0:00:16.000 ---> 0:00:23.000 ] Speaker B : 27,000 royalty payments were paid to 1800 NIH employees.
[ 0:00:23.000 ---> 0:00:24.000 ] Speaker A : And he asks Fauci straight up, he.
[ 0:00:24.000 ---> 0:00:34.000 ] Speaker B : Goes, can you tell me that you have not received a royalty from any entity that you ever oversaw the distribution of money in research grants?
[ 0:00:34.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker A : And Fauci, in a roundabout way is.
[ 0:00:37.000 ---> 0:00:47.000 ] Speaker B : Like, according to the regulations, people who receive royalties are not required to divulge them even on their financial statement.
[ 0:00:47.000 ---> 0:00:58.000 ] Speaker A : Don't you think? Like, shouldn't we know that? Shouldn't at least be able to know how much money does Fauci make from Pfizer and Moderna? Because that seems like a tiny conflict of interest, a giant conflict of interest.
