- Thank you, everybody, for joining. We have Pat McNab, the co founder of Tracer Adam, the business development over at Tracer. Or I'll for HQs Corn, product manager for Pools Trader. Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the Tracer AMA chat.
- Tracer is a smart contract protocol for derivatives. Since September about $350,000,000 in volume traded through the perpetual pool contracts. Given ERC 20 inputs, Tracer will enable the creation of many different markets that service different needs.
- There's a big gap right now as to how finance is being communicated to people. There's a massive opportunity in actually simplifying these products and making them just price insurance. In that sense, there's going to be so many different ways that finance is actually connecting to the user.
- Tracer offers leveraged tokens that can be traded in a variety of different exchanges. What differentiates Tracer from its competitors? Is it its ease of use? How it's structured?
- Coming with V Two, we're going to be offering permissionless deployment of new perpetual pool markets. One market that we're particularly excited about launching alongside V Two is a punk floor index. An effective hedging mechanism for users that actually hold crypto punks.
- Tracer V Two will allow for long term holds, commissionless, deploy factory and no minimum commit size. I think it'll be great to see people with even just $50 or $60 worth of ETH or USDC being able to mint a pool token.
- We're also looking to extend our vision out to the real world assets. So something like the housing market, if there's a certain housing market that has high capital and high barrier to entry. All this stuff is going to connect probably with Oracles to just both thereal world and this digital world.
- V Two introduces long term leverage tokens. The tokens suffer from a little bit of volatility decay. Now you can hold these tokens in cold storage again or in your wallet for months on end and suffer significantly less volatility decay or decay of the token. I could definitely see that being a pretty big product, especially for centralized exchanges.
- The Tracer Token is being used as a governance within the Tracer community. It also means that governors can vote for new products to be created. There are no current barriers in terms of if there's any idea that's put forth to the Dow.
- Tracer v. Two has been a very first principle centric development for us. We have this set of fundamental beliefs that these financial tools should be accessible for everyone. But there's always times where we have a setback.
- Do you guys envision Tracer kind of just like a front end app that people kind of use or also kind of like this infrastructure that can be built on top of. We're really open to having people come in and build on top the really fundamental points that Pat touched.
- Tracer's main focus is to build more DeFi native products. We're really starting to offer these risk management products on top of the Tracer infrastructure again. Mid year we'll be pushing for a perpetual swap infrastructure that will also be accompanying the perpetual pools.
- Tracer will continue to provide simple risk management tools for people to manage their just crypto native risk. As more and more tokens and utility tokens are being created within the DeFi economy, you're going to see a massive explosion of new financial needs.
- How do you get the price for a punk? It's a weighted index or time weighted index of most recent purchases and floor prices for the punks. There's going to be a lot of transparency around how that pricing is achieved.
- Some of the punks are fairly illiquid, as in they're not traded too often. There's products that are starting to provide appraisals for what those punks may be worth. It'll primarily just be the floor pricing because with that you can really gain a much more solid and non exploitable pricing function.
- Tracer will offer a variety of different foreign exchange markets that are set up to be traded with leverage. We've also ideated a few different flipping markets. If there's any particular markets that you guys are keen on, we'd love to hear from you and work towards developing those.
- Hunter: Can you kind of give us a little idea of how we can kind of contribute to Tracer if someone wants to and in the future? Izzy: Our squadron infrastructure is basically Dow work, decentralized work. There's also the ability for members to request new work.
