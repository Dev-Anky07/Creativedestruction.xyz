- This is our 46th Apecoin Dow Special Counsel Debrief presented by Apecoms. We've now got three Ape chain proposals live on the forum with only more potentially pending. If anybody else wants to join us on the stage, go ahead and send an invite.
- Lost. It seems like your energetic has returned. Over 50 AIPS in process, over 30 approved over the past couple of months. Now I'm curious where your actual office is and what the actual view from the office looks like. More to be discussed later.
- Good morning. Great to be here. Exciting times. We got elections coming, a bunch of great people running. I'm stacking notes up on Jerry, all sorts of notes. I got plenty of other notes for the other council members here and Vera. Let's go.
- Vera, you gave us a bunch of notes this week. I want to let you know I could not hear adventurous when she was speaking. Don't want you to miss out on any possible questions. Follow up later.
- I'm finally back to 100%. No longer sick. Feeling good, feeling excited. Lots happening in the Dow. Love it. Even your notes were sick this week. Super busy day and super busy week, but that's what we want.
- Do you celebrate Thanksgiving in October with the rest of Canada? Half of the Dows and half of the banks are not open tomorrow. Tomorrow it's more like just chilling football every Thanksgiving.
- Good morning. Happy Thanksgiving. My platform is to agree with everybody and promise everything no matter what. Free turkeys for everybody next. And also we'll be having a party congratulations, election party at one of the local brothels. Let's see who else we got.
- There are multiple kinds of goldfish, including white Cheddar, Oreo, pizza and Swedish fish. There's also ranges of size, too. The day before Thanksgiving is the time to be day drinking with your friends and family. Long live chaos and mayhem.
- Mac 1835 was purchased by Angel Drainer, who's one of the biggest scammers in the space. He's giving it away to whoever scams the most on December 9. Why is this series? You just get total degenerates applying for all of the roles.
- "I'm loving the stage, man. All the Aquamarines here, we got even the Aquamarine alien friend. And we got the main man, Captain Trippy in here too, so love it. " All right, we're moving on.
- I got a really cool keynote spot that popped up at the Dow Athens events. I'm going to stay focused on what Apecoms is all about and the theme of Wednesdays of special counsel. Two really cool questions popped up and primed and loaded. Love being here.
- Uzi: Glad to have you up here with us today. Read the special counsel's notes. Everything we discuss is our personal opinion and not representative of the Apecoin Foundation. If you have any questions, jump in whenever you feel like it.
- G, you said in your notes this week that you are working through your tasks. Should you not have the opportunity to remain after this term? What does that mean? Can you explain how you can continue to do work after you've left office?
- The Special Counsel has always been mindful of ensuring that they're set up for success. Smooth onboarding, having guardrails, having guidelines, having expectations, it's important for successful people to be successful. Progress is being made, but not at the pace that him or most other people would like.
- As a business professional, how are you thinking that we might improve in this way in the Dow? In order to do that, in my opinion, we need a better foundation than what we currently have. I definitely see the balance that SC helps provide between the foundation and the community.
- I am running for Special Counsel on a single issue. My Main Thing Is I Think The Special Counsel should be the Board stewarding, the Ape Foundation. I think it's much better messaging, narrative, easier to grasp.
- SSP: I'm glad to see you throw your hat in the ring and good luck. And we've got obviously three Dow members going off, new members that will be up for vote. So three spots available. Two of the current SC, two of the three are not running and that one G is running.
- How do you feel that this Apoin management team that you're envisioning is different than what the working group structure is ultimately meant to address. The working groups are decentralized autonomous teams made up of community members working towards community driven goals. These two concepts are very able to work complementary with one another.
- Sut Mount: I think Apecoin Dao is very unique in the way that the existing. structure and this kind of majority execution team. If we don't have that killing team that who wanted to take the lead and have the community trusted to do it, I personally would rather not have that management team.
- Because of the time barrier, like language barrier, it is quite difficult for communities. Culture is quite different in the east as well. I feel like in the future every language working group should exist. So super looking forward to see what's going to happen after we have the new SC landed on.
- Vera is the original apecoin. Dow delegate. The original expert of amassing the community and getting people aligned together. This is the last time she really has this obligation. We got to take advantage.
- Vera: I think it's a great idea to empower the community and they're not really asking anything. Since we have this new process that will probably be able to go like asking the people that who are interested to go to this new trademark process. Once people see one or two examples, more people will jump in with different proposals.
- Thanks Vera, for giving us all the extra updates. Thank you for hosting and I'll be taking tomorrow off for Thanksgiving. As things develop for the SC elections and other elections are coming up, it's election season. Get ready.
- It's right on topic of what SSB brought up and the role of special counsel. How much of the roles and responsibilities should be taken as absolutes for special counsel members. And this is just about creating clear expectations with new candidates coming in.
- The entire role is always been an advisory board. It's always been that we had to operationalize the Dow internally. I do envision that a lot of that work should be transitioned off. That should really evolve. And I think that's how we should really see this special counsel working towards this transition.
- Bunch of notes this week we had a bunch of notes in there. I need to be reminded to read them sometimes. What I rely on is apecoms. I'm happy for Apecoms to give us the TLDR on those notes.
- You can always just type in AIP, whatever law says, and it'll come right up on the forum. Any AIP we're talking about at the time, you can search it up. Nobody's going to remember AIP 305.
- "Some good questions in there. I'm glad we had the conversation about what is the space for special counsel, " he said. Hopefully those for the next two and a half, three weeks, we can have those conversations in a respectful and spirited manner, of course.
- Aaron: We are definitely going to be considering and looking at changing our cadence and creating content with the Apecoin Twitter account. Can we have a special Apecom session tomorrow for like a therapy session or something? I promise I will read all of the reports this week.
- Irvin: I would love to have a session from Apecons just on Ape chain and bring over a lot of the folks from the ecosystem. He says there needs to be a more well informed discussion. Irvin: Tonight, tomorrow, whatever we're doing, I'll be there with you at 04:00.
- AIP 41 should be reverted. What they often need is just a set of questions that they can prepare for. It's very critical that we align these questions so that we can get the most information right out of it. But the answer I'm getting so far is no from a few different parties.
- I don't want to see Ape Cham be just like another CK EVM L two with data availability. There needs to be a core differentiator if we're going to become a quote unquote gaming chain. The biggest barrier is not TPS.
- On 41, it does say that Apecoin would remain in Ethereum or an L two scaling solution secured by Ethereum. But it says it doesn't preclude subsequent AIPS from suggesting a move to an L Two scaling solution. There is only technically three month period for confliction with any proposal.
- Manny: It would be great to have a developer for want to a better term, working group, a Devs working group. What I encourage everybody in the community is keep an eye out for Apecoin related spaces. And then please ping any of us up in APCOMS.
- My timeline is full of Apecoin. Love hearing from USP. Can't wait to have these discussions. Thanks again for listening, but lost over.
- Hammond: I'd like to comment specifically on Ape chain and my perspective on it as a developer. One concern I have about specifically making an Ethereum layer two is the gas fees. I think there's a misconception between people thinking that l two S provide all this optimizations. We need to educate folks a bit more.
- There's this AIP 305 breakdown every week and it's where the special counsel puts their notes out. If we could stop from getting to that point and we could provide clarity on some of the information that's already out there. There's always more to do.
- We always talk about how do we bring in new people to Apecoin Dow. Helena's created tons of our graphic content. People learn in different ways, visual, audio, whatever it may be. So I got to throw it to Helena.
- A year ago today, apoms were voted out of the Dow. Today, the governance working group has been really up and running. If you look back to where the Dow was a year ago, you can really see a night and day difference.
- Manny: I really love our current conversation about Ape chain. We need to attract so many more builders to the ecosystem. I would actually be down to go to our hot chocolate spot in that mascot suit. We do want to have the discussion. The ape chain is looming.
- Only about 40% of AIPS that go to vote all get voted down. Aims to establish a bit more positive signaling on what voters would vote positively on prior to AIPS being written. Could probably not be ratified into an official capacity.
- AIP 266 is looking to implement a temperature check process for the Dow. What he wants to do is add a. process where anybody in the Dow could submit a temperature. check to the community to get a signal on what they might be voting. Aaron, check it out, because we definitely some changes to the proposal.
- No author should assume that if they get 100, 200 positive comments that that has anything to do with the number of votes. At the same time, you need to look at the delegates and their ideas are important, but they're also going to be voting with potentially millions of Apecoin, which can sway the outcome of your vote.
- As a builder, many of whom are maybe even outside our community, they have to take a lot of time to even get the AIP to the voting process itself. Having the right calibrated expectations is important for the community. We want governance, marketing, communications, we want the Metaverse.
- I'm curious, what are the equivalent roles. What are the comparable roles going to be under Marketing and Communications? Everybody wants that high visibility. Who wants to get stuff done?
- Well, luckily they got you SSP you're free. There's a reason why we're at 20,000,004 and 23 votes against, right? We're zero cost. People with zero cost for a year and a half. Zero cost but infinite value. Priceless. Absolutely priceless.
- Raymond: I love the ranga ape. I do have Ranga assets. I did put my name in the hat for the governance council. After kind of looking at the load and stuff, I think I fit pretty good into either spot.
- The governance working group is interesting for you. If it's something I have to see in there, I'm going to keep grinding on it. I've been here sort of spinning my wheels on the apes, been kind of a slow, steady grind.
- Mark Palm: We're going to get information about all of our nominees and our special counsel or governance or Metaverse Mark Palm's nominees shortly. We're still going to need additional proposals to figure out how we carry our governance structure over what sort of products we want on the chain.
- Has anybody up here actually used optimism? Have you used it? Bradley. What if apes could run their own nodes, validator nodes. If we can get that kind of conversation started about the Ape chain sooner than later, I would love that.
- I'm going to start streaming from our proper United Grand Halls account. Is Apeclams now in any way beholden to the Dow? I would like permission to livecast these spaces. How do I get permission to stream these?
- Good. Looking forward to the Thanksgiving, at least for those in the US. Send all the food. Outstanding. As soon as we're done here, I'm going right to sleep. I'm waking up at 12:00 a. m.
- I invite all of you to go and read Irving's primer on Ape Chain. Just tap on Irving's icon avatar there, go to his feed and look for the link. The more the dao grows, the more we streamline things. Those voices are going to get heard.
- There's a lot of ways we can do an Ape Chain. You can't create a football field without having players to come and play on it. Now is this time for us to start talking about what are we going to build on it?
- We need to start thinking about what to build on Ape chain. Ultimately, we want to get to this place of more automation and governance. Good luck on the elections. The entire Dow is entering a tipping point. So somebody better win decisively.
- "I'm putting together something where we can create a dev group with some of the best minds in the Dao " If you try to put something fishy in that AIP, we might snipe it. We want to capture some in house developers so that everything doesn't cost so much.
- Garrett: Happy Thanksgiving to all my American friends. We take Canadian time zones. If you want to have it up near Christmas, that's cool, too. He wishes you all love and the best during these holidays.
- Klon and Cool cats will be in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade tomorrow with the big cool Cats balloon and his cool cats merch. As a cat holder I'm also very excited about it. We could do cool cute stuff. These things are possible.
- Brad: Dates are probably the highest hanging fruit that I know of and they're here on the palm trees in Las Vegas. Spend some time with the family. If you go on Amazon to buy them, make sure you take a look at the ratings for the particular seller.
- When I saw those videos and images, something told me that that guy must be looking through the mouth. So awkward. Will we do these Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or we have for the past year? Friday we'll have different discussion.
- You have until 06:00 p. m. PST you have just over 3 hours to get your votes in for the proposals that are up to vote this week. We're looking to the forum for nominee statements to be posted be posted by the Governance Working Group. Going to be a great season.
- We'll be here Friday. If you have any questions, hit up Luca. He's in the audience down there. We'll definitely have more of these discussions Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays. Get your votes in 06:00 p. m. PST 09:00pm PST.
- There are pending proposals posted, so you can check those out as well. You could start reading, start preparing for voting for next week. Have a nice weekend, everybody.
