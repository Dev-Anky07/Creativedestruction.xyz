[ 0:00:00.000 ---> 0:00:01.000 ] Speaker A : And this is one thing I say. I'm like.
[ 0:00:01.000 ---> 0:00:01.000 ] Speaker B : It's.
[ 0:00:01.000 ---> 0:00:37.000 ] Speaker A : It's visible to anyone that has eyes to see. But it turns out that the Sahara Desert is one of the least studied places on Earth, mostly because it's so inhospitable. It's an average of 125 degrees Fahrenheit much of the year. It is so unbelievably big that just to get out there, I mean, you need reliable aircraft or vehicles. There is. Most of the countries out there are, I regret to say, third World, that you just don't have supplies. It's not feasible to just travel out there with a whole team on a whim. So most of it is essentially undocumented and it's not a site. The Sarah as a whole isn't a site that gets much attention, unfortunately.
[ 0:00:37.000 ---> 0:00:39.000 ] Speaker C : Ben, we got to bring you in. Otherwise.
[ 0:00:39.000 ---> 0:02:14.000 ] Speaker B : No, I was going to say something that you mentioned about the origin of, I guess Plato's description. You said it was mud and grasses, was like the aftermath. It's interesting, it's the topic I've been exploring recently is that does match some of the translations of origin stories from the ancient Egyptians. So it's like that. The Temple of Horus at Edphutes is amazing structure, but it's literally covered head to toe in hieroglyphs and descriptions and all these types of things. But one of the stories in the translations they do talk about is this, what they would call the original point or the primordial mound, the primordial island. They describe it as being an island that was surrounded by water that was sinking, and essentially these reeds that were growing on it that created a falcon's perch. And then the god, it was either Horus or Hurun or one of the falcon gods alights on this perch and then gains divinity. But as part of that story, and then he goes and forms Kemet, essentially the motherland, Egypt. And it's this tale of them, I guess, their civilization moving and migrating to this new land. But they do talk about a whole stack of unknown gods and a whole culture that existed before that. It's an interesting correlation. It's something that Graham Hancock speculated about in his work with the Temple of Horus at EDfu. They also have catastrophic flood myths and things like this. But it may be that whatever prior civilization and that might have been where the dynastic Egyptians actually got their origins from, because it seems clear that they've inherited some things from the past. That's a story they themselves tell.
[ 0:02:14.000 ---> 0:02:18.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah, I wasn't aware that the story of Atlantis had come from Egypt.
[ 0:02:18.000 ---> 0:02:30.000 ] Speaker A : That's one of the most bizarre parts about it. I didn't know this until just a few years ago either. It's like, oh, wait a second, Plato didn't just Plato, his distant relative Solon had traveled there in search of knowledge because Egypt was the place to go for it.
[ 0:02:31.000 ---> 0:03:04.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. It was the priests of the Delta that told Solon and they said that. Yeah. So 6000 years or 9000 years. Sorry. Prior to the time of Solon was when the sinking of this city happened. And that works out to be 9600 BC. So 11,600 years ago, which is bang on exactly where now the geological evidence points to basically the end of the younger dress. Cataclysms, like something we know something happened at the start at like 12,800, 900 years. And then 11,600 years ago was that end of the younger Dryas that brought us up out of the cold spell and into the Holocene.
[ 0:03:04.000 ---> 0:03:19.000 ] Speaker C : Isn't it crazy? That's a full thousand years. And we think about it in the same time period. Like, yeah, I mean, around that time, literally 11,600 to 12,800. We're literally talking about 1000 fucking years. It's so much time.
[ 0:03:19.000 ---> 0:03:41.000 ] Speaker A : It's so much time that actually, if you go from 12,008, so basically, let's say 1200 years, the English language, Old English, is only like 1400 years and modern English is only like four or 500 years. So this is such a wide, a long period of time that we weren't even speaking the same language in that same thousand years ago. When you think of it like that, it's like it's a different world.
[ 0:03:41.000 ---> 0:04:24.000 ] Speaker C : It's nuts. And if you think about the people that lived a thousand years ago and how they know all of this, that I've learned from Graham Hancock and from Randall Carlson and from you guys, all of it is so astonishing and it all fits into place. It all makes sense. Like, why are we so fucked up? Why is civilization so wacky? Why do we have these weird structures that no one can really explain? And when you think about the fact that there's so much evidence that we were hit by comets, that we were hit by large objects, like, I didn't know about that enormous crater that's in Antarctica.
[ 0:04:24.000 ---> 0:04:25.000 ] Speaker B : Oh, yes.
[ 0:04:26.000 ---> 0:04:30.000 ] Speaker A : I don't know all the details on how old that one's supposed to be, but it's one of the largest, isn't it?
[ 0:04:30.000 ---> 0:04:36.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, there's a big one in Antarctica. I don't know that much about it, but another one that you. Have you heard of Burkel Crater? That's another one.
[ 0:04:36.000 ---> 0:04:37.000 ] Speaker C : Yes.
[ 0:04:37.000 ---> 0:04:40.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah. Burkel Crater. Like the 20 miles hole on the bottom of the Indian Ocean?
[ 0:04:41.000 ---> 0:04:41.000 ] Speaker C : Yeah.
[ 0:04:41.000 ---> 0:04:42.000 ] Speaker B : It's crazy.
[ 0:04:42.000 ---> 0:04:43.000 ] Speaker C : And when is that supposed to be?
[ 0:04:43.000 ---> 0:05:31.000 ] Speaker B : So that was 5000 years ago. They've dated that. It's something plopped down in the Indian Ocean and it washed up these mega tsunamis on the coast of Madagascar and Western Australia that we can see in satellite images today. These got these like 5600 foot high chevrons from where the water went miles inland. And they found organic material from the seabed in these chevrons. And then they date that with carbon 14 dating and they put it right at 5000 years ago. So 2500 around that time BC, which is actually a really interesting date when you consider some of the, I guess the publications that we rely on in our modern civilization today. The Bible, the Old Testament wasn't written long after that. And if you think about where the Indian Ocean is, that could have been the source of the biblical flood. Like, that would have washed up north into the Persian Gulf, flooded the hell out of that whole region.
[ 0:05:31.000 ---> 0:05:56.000 ] Speaker C : It's just crazy that it's happened so many times. We like to think of history as being this linear thing. We started out as cave people. We branched out from Africa, all across the world and kept learning. And here we are today with cell. Bet we've been rocked like multiple times. Many, many times. And there's real solid evidence. The Antarctica one. How old do they think that is?
[ 0:05:56.000 ---> 0:05:58.000 ] Speaker A : I don't recall on that. I have to double check that.
[ 0:05:58.000 ---> 0:05:59.000 ] Speaker C : I'd have to do a Google.
[ 0:05:59.000 ---> 0:06:00.000 ] Speaker A : Jamie.
[ 0:06:01.000 ---> 0:06:13.000 ] Speaker C : So researchers have discovered a crater 1.5 km beneath the Antarctica Ice crust, 482 km in diameter. 482 km in diameter. Holy shit.
[ 0:06:13.000 ---> 0:06:14.000 ] Speaker A : What is that?
[ 0:06:14.000 ---> 0:06:20.000 ] Speaker C : Probably dates back to a meteorite impact 250,000,000 years ago. Wow. Okay, so that's an old one.
[ 0:06:20.000 ---> 0:06:30.000 ] Speaker B : That's like an order of magnitude bigger than anything related. Even with the younger dry. I mean, that's bigger than the dinosaur one. Yeah, that's like a 99 point whatever percent extinction event.
[ 0:06:30.000 ---> 0:06:39.000 ] Speaker C : So it just keeps happening over millions and millions of years and thousands of years that humans have been around. The Earth just keeps getting whacked.
[ 0:06:39.000 ---> 0:07:09.000 ] Speaker A : The evidence is so overwhelming, say going back to the younger, driest period of time. There's evidence when you say get whacked. More than 30% of all landmass at that time was charred, burned. They claim that it's more fires than existed in the time of the dinosaurs. Now I don't know if that's an article I read on Science Alert. I don't know if they can truly prove that, but if nothing else, 30% of all landmass existing today was burned and scorched to death at that period of time. That helps people to wrap their heads around. Like the world was on fire.
[ 0:07:09.000 ---> 0:07:30.000 ] Speaker B : Yeah, that's the younger, dryest mat they estimate as part of the burning, because there was floods and fire. And this correlates to a lot of origin myths from cultures all around the world. But, yeah, 10% of the biomass, I think the nine to 10% of the, which is an inconceivable number of. That's how much of the world was burnt and that's now embedded in this black 10% biomass.
[ 0:07:30.000 ---> 0:07:41.000 ] Speaker C : It's so crazy that there's literally a dark line in the ground, in the ground that shows where everything was on fire for a long fucking time. Crazy.
[ 0:07:41.000 ---> 0:07:56.000 ] Speaker B : We barely survived it. We now have a correlation of not only population reduction, but a significant drop in genetic diversity as a result, like it's tied to the younger Dryas. There's been a few good studies recently done at that. So we were one of the megafauna.
