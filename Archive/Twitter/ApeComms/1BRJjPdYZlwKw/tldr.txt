- Today is just a combo space with the Apecoms crew and the ladies of Buc crew. Should we bring up the Marcons people up first and set up the know? Lorelord Peak, Lore Popple, Snowflake, and Toby, please request. Markoms has less nominations, candidates, and might be easier to fill.
- Marketing and communications stewards are the folks that we expect to be professionals at marketing and communications. Sometimes being a leader means hiring people to know when things are not necessarily your expertise. We will ask these questions just a little bit differently than we did in the previous round. And we will still just keep that five minute timer.
- Sad Fez Ape: I'm really excited to be a part of the emerging metaverses. I feel that we have the opportunity to fully impact what's coming up as the other side. I will be working with the work group members to cooperate on a strategy. We should make it as a success for the success of the community.
- What type of initiatives do you hope to support? I know you spoke about collaborating sort of directly with Yuga and they are one of the launch partners for the token. But I think the priority should be experiment within the other side first to fully support.
- My definition of metaverse is everything other than in real life. We are already there, but it will emerge, it will change in nature. This is just going to grow as other side and as the ape community. We should definitely be the ones who define how it's going to move forward.
- Special counsel and governance elections going live next Wednesday. There are also aips up for vote. We also have our community hour tomorrow at noon pst. We're going to be announcing some stuff this week in support of the election coverage.
