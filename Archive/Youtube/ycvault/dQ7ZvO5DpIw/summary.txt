- Stanford professor: What is it that actually makes a great founder? He says it's not the image of founder as superwoman or Superman. No one is universally superpowered. It's hard to tell the difference between madness and genius, he says.
- Most often, it's best to have two or three people on a team rather than a solar founder. If you have different skills, you can compensate for each other's weaknesses. One of the things that I suggest when you look at essentially a founding team is to have a high degree of trust for those co founders.
- The next thing is location. What great founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their problem and their task. In order to be successful, I have to go to where the strongest networks are for the particular kind of problem.
- It's actually pretty easy to be contrarian. How does a smart person actually disagree with me? Right? And contrarian is always relative to an audience. Good consumer internet people think is actually not yet a good idea.
- In general, as a founder, it's good to be contrarian in the real sense. While most consumer internet startups tend to be only successful at their rocket ships, a gradual compounding curve can actually be very, very valuable.
-  entrepreneurs are frequently given the advice to have a vision. The other piece of advice given with equal vigor is listen to data, listen to customers pivot. Being a great founder is being able to hold the belief but also listen to criticism.
- Part of what makes a great founder is the ability to be flexible across these lines. Data only exists within the framework of a vision that you're building to a hypothesis. How do you take intelligent risks as an entrepreneur?
- Part of having an investment thesis is charting it out. The initial set of adoption will come from essentially people who are willing to play with it. Eventually the mass market will come on as they begin to have a network that is already delivering a value proposition. And that's part of thinking through minimizing the risks as you're actually executing.
- Should I have a long term vision or should I be solving local near term problems? And again, the answer is both. The next level down on strategy is usually product distribution. If it doesn't get to customers, you're hosed.
- So how do you know if you might be a great founder? Well, you should have some superpowers. Founders can be very diverse. They can be extraordinarily talented at different areas. There's an ability to learn and adapt. And your ability to cross uneven ground in a fog.
- One of the really fundamental things is to think about product distribution as key. How do you tell if someone's a good founder or not? Well, I'm a huge believer in references. And it's that network that's really key.
- Density of insight is a strong signal for great founders. You have to be able to articulate a very clear mission about what you're doing. Ultimately for me, this gets back to the investment thesis as a mechanism.
- The kinds of things that frequently get wrong are when you think that a person because they like. Most often the kind of reference questions I ask about founders is like adaptability. Each entrepreneurial pattern is to some degree unique and new. Can you learn the new one right as way of doing it?
- The first thing is it's super important that you collaborate really well. If you in fact don't have pretty good serious trust kind of a way of it's 150 that I'm supposed to end. So I will have time for more questions.
- Do you have a diversity of the necessary strengths across the whole range of strengths that would be useful? What you're looking for is, do they collaborate well? Do they help each other get to truth? That collective problem solving is the kind of thing that actually usually makes great teams.
- So I would like to ask you how to identify the great funders in different sectors. Different founders, different areas, how do you identify them? There are attributes that are unique per domain.
- How do you know when to pivot? If your confidence is decreasing, that's a seriously good time to think about pivoting. A frequent mistake when it comes to pivoting is wait until you've essentially crashed into the wall.
- One of the classic questions is balance. And I actually think founders have no balance. That's the reason why the jumping off the cliff metaphor is one of the ones that I classically use. Depends on the idea of identifying uncertain opportunities.
- How good is the startup ecosystem at identifying contrarian opportunities? The moment it kind of actually becomes in vogue, it's less contrarian. Sometimes things that are just kind of like totally crazy. Is bitcoin the first or last cryptocurrency?
- How do you think about creating markets versus discovering them? It is, of course, conceptually possible to create markets. However, it can sometimes completely flame out.
- How do you know that you trust someone well enough to be a co founder? There's a whole bunch of different variables that go into it. One of the things that I frequently think is worth covering is almost like kind of the divorce.
