- Greece has been famed in recent years for its not so fantastic economy. The subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 was bad for many, many nations. Iceland, Spain, France have all more or less found their feet again after the global financial crisis. But Greece? Well, Greece has somewhat lagged behind.
- Greece has the largest merchant marine fleet in the entire world. As the world becomes more dependent on global trade, it will become more and more dependent upon Greek ships to facilitate that trade. Greece made the mistake of assuming that the good times of the early 2000s would go on forever.
- The key disadvantage of a common currency is that it limits the ability of an economy to suffer in silence. A depreciating currency means that suddenly Greece is more competitive in world markets. The modern Greek economy has a crisis of confidence. But it's not all doom and gloom.
