- John Alexander is the author of Citizens Why the Key to Fixing Everything Is All of US. He is co founder of the New Citizenship Project, a company that works to shift the dominant story of the individual in society from consumer to citizen. We will be talking about pirates today, so stay.
- Author's background is in the advertising industry. He sees society through the lens of three stories: subject, consumer and citizen. He believes the consumer story is collapsing in on itself. And arguably the deepest truth of humanity is what he calls the citizen story.
- Dows is one manifestation of that story emerging, this broad phenomenon, the work I do in the world. I run a little consulting business now that tries to speak to people as citizens rather than just as consumers. The authoritarian voice comes through strong and offers a false simplicity, but one that's very attractive in this time.
- Dows largely are kind of people building dows are seeing these problems and wanting to build solutions for that into the future. And this really is where the pirates came in, right?
- In many ways, I don't think dows are new in purpose and spirit. The underlying argument is that humans are citizens by nature. And when we are just sort of shushed, or told what to do and denied agency, we end up wanting to seek agency and find a way to do it.
- Sandy: How do we do this work in a way that genuinely tries to step into the responsibility that's needed. He says the challenges we face are caused by the story from which our institutions evolved. Sandy: I'm fearful as both for the existing institutions and for you and where this might go.
- My hope for the future is that we can evolve the institutions and structures of our society into what I call the citizen story. Some of these experiments are taking shape and scale, but we're in a super dangerous moment. How do you envision the future?
- John: I'd love to know more about where the Pirate Code came from. The first code that we know of was the articles of Henry Morgan and other Buccaneers from the early 1670s. Each ship essentially had its own code or each collection of ships. Do wade in with more questions and stuff on the Chat.
- I'm thinking about, let's say, the strategy to knock on the door. Find the governments, I guess, that are naturally most receptive to this. Framing this as governance innovation and trying to ally it with other governance innovations. How do we make something ready for that moment that can be adopted?
- What kind of tools do we need to cultivate in ourselves to be better citizens? There are instances still surviving in a criminal underclass of basically traditions that go back well over 100 years. My worry is that those sorts of rules that you're talking about tend to occur once chaos has already arrived.
- One of the big challenges in this space is scale. How do we make that work in Small? I'm super curious about how you see this relating to the Balaji Sunavasan's work on the Network State and the Charter Cities Institute. I'm interested in how do we design for a whole society.
- John: I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. Fascinating. I can talk for hours with you about this, so really appreciate you being.
