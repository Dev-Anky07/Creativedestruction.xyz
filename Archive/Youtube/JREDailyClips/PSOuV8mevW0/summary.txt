- You can actually see the Nazanov gland in that video in that little clip. It's a little gland that's exposed, and that's one of the pheromones, the ways they communicate. She is signaling to all the other bees where to go, and she's letting them know.
- A large colony tends to be more defensive than a smaller one because they have more resources to defend. A wall or the side of a shed is a common place that I remove bees from. Bees choose to live. It's ideal for what the bees want in an environment.
- Not much flavor, in my opinion. Is it as bioavailable as like chicken or beef. We wouldn't want to harvest as much pollen from bees as we do other protein sources. This is their food source, so we shouldn't really be to take.
