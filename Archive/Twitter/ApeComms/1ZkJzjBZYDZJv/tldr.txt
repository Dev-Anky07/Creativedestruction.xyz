- Welcome to the apecoin AIP roundup. Number 55. And we have five proposals up for vote. You guys got till Wednesday to get your votes in for these ones. There will still be plenty of room for other people to join us up here. Feel free, send requests.
- Apecoms team spends an average of 555 days per team member on the forum. SSP doesn't agree with the exact numbers. But our combined daily activity and discourse represents a total time spent of 3858 days.
- It's encouragement versus support. We want to encourage people to submit their ideas. Ultimately, when it comes time to support people, the conversation changes. It goes from that encouragement to was there feedback provided? Was that feedback applied?
- Aaron: Is there a way that you can structure some of these items a little bit more like a loyalty program? He asks: Should a board ape or a mutant holder with no ape coin, no involvement. Should that NFT holder get the same benefit funded by apecoin as an apecoin token holder?
- The original benefit of the apecoin and the Dow was for apes and mutants. But mochaverse NFT holders want to benefit from it as well. That's one of the reasons why going back to all city said 50,000 bottles, that covers everyone.
- Join Lord Lord today. Set your alarm. Don't forget to get those votes in SSP. Tonight, chaos and mayhem. It's going to be there.
