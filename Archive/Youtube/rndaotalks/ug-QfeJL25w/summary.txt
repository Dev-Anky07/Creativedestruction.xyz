- I've been doing network analysis work with organizations for about 1015 years now. My background is in organization development and change. What network analysis gave me as a tool that helped illuminate that informal network. Make sure to cover the space is yours.
- Network analysis is visual, so it's helpful to have some visuals as we go. We'll look at two organizations and how they applied network analysis. Feel free to jump in if there's something that doesn't make sense along the way.
- Bayer Crop Science was an organization that was very siloed. They needed a lot more innovation and change ability within their organization. What they did is connected strategies to networks. This is something that I think actually works very well in corporations.
- The maps were used to coach leaders. They looked at the expertise network and the innovation network. One leader realized she needed to stop worrying about proving herself. She needed to start encouraging creativity in the organization.
- You mentioned doing an in womb exercise about the SNA. Can you talk more about that? I love doing this with groups because it makes it real. It was an interesting moment of helping folks realize that they didn't have the full picture.
- In that scenario when you asked people to arrange themselves, did you see much shifting occur? Did you see people get up and physically walk around and reorganize themselves? You can see some of the network just in how people naturally sit.
- Daniel: What do you think is the scale at which this becomes very impactful? Even within a small team you can start to see some patterns. I think as a leadership tool, I wish more people would use it for a leadership development. Any particular resources that you would recommend related to the leadership piece?
- Network evolution organizations tend to get that it helps them make sense of these maps. Here's a concrete example of the good that learning about networks can do. National Braille Press found people weren't collaborating in the organization. People were doing more exchange across divisions than within divisions. This was worrying.
- So that's a little bit on National Bread Press. We might have time to do one more. If anyone has a burning question, please feel free to raise your hand. It's on the reactions button at the bottom.
- Using networks in a Texas town and a biopharmaceutical women's network. The Women's Success Network was designed to help women grow and become promoted in the company. Results show that there were more people available for mentoring in 2014 than in 2013.
- Maya: Could you speak a bit more about how do you define it and measure it? She is using Karen Stevenson's work and I can send you the article with the math in it. What I'm really curious about is how this relates to your work.
- In the transition from the old CEO to the new CEO, that fun had been lost. Have you seen that this is a problem with other organizations as well? Particularly organizations that are post some sort of intense or traumatic event. How did you introduce fun?
- The feedback loops mean that change isn't predictable. What's really important is to look at their critical connectors. Put something structural in to encourage that collaboration. It tends to work best at the critical connector level because they're so connected.
- Kibo: I'm wondering about the correlation between critical connectors and overload or being stretched too thin. He says one interesting area of exploration would be that bottlenecks are caused potentially by people who are overloaded. And we found that it tracked pretty well from one assumption to another.
- There is a correlation sometimes between being a critical connector and being overloaded, and then sometimes there isn't because those folks are overlooked. Going down beyond the usual suspects to the next group can often be really helpful. One of the causes of overload of critical connectors is that this work isn't measured or valued.
- I imagine this would be really helpful for folks who are remote and hybrid because you just don't see each other all the time. You can also use networks to help find matches and Wimberly, that was the town in Texas. I think great, great potential for using networks in remote workplaces.
