- Panel features bio and healthcare investors from Andreessen horowitz, koslav ventures and venroc. Moderator Ethan Perlstein is a YC alum and the founder of Perlara. Perlara was the very first bio public benefit corporation. Cammie, please go first.
- Cammie Samuels: Healthcare is deeply personal for me. Venoc has been around since the late 1960s. I do a lot of orphan disease investing, but just diseases for which there aren't great therapies. Please look at someone who really wants to get products to patients.
- Vinnie Taggerwal is one of the investing partners at Andreessen horowitz, part of our BioHealth fund team. We share a lot of the DNA that YC brings to you all, and that for both prospective and current YC founders. It's really exciting to be here, and we look forward to working together.
- I lead our health and bioinvesting practice. For us, that's everything from healthcare services, AI radiology, drug discovery platforms, deployed healthcare, digital health, and some devices. I've been at Coastal Ventures for seven years now.
- Early stage technical founders tend to emphasize near term risk and deemphasize long term risk. Truth seeking is a quality I look for in entrepreneurs. Your deal inevitably has warts.
- At the earliest stages of company building, most of what you think will happen is not going to happen. We like asking questions about what if? What if this doesn't happen? What would you do next as your next experiment? These are all questions that we call navigating the Idea Maze.
- More than ever, especially for an early stage deep tech company, there is a lot of future financing risk. Success is a consolidation of amazing talent trying to do the impossible. The right business model also has to fit the right moment.
- Best companies are created during a downturn. Strategy is about making choices. Be working backwards from your seed financing. Use it as a way to think through what milestones are going to be really attractive to a Series A investor.
- I did a lot of work on investment on a company called AveXis. It violated sort of every stereotype of what VCs are supposed to invest in. But I didn't put the early stage funds money in it, saying it was too expensive. It ended up being a really nice outcome.
- There are too many any honest investor will tell you there aretoo many misses to name. Sometimes just remember that your investors have certain mandates with their LPs and certain kind of areas in which they plan to invest. Keeping in touch can really be great at a personal level.
- Vanita: How do you gauge your partnership when you're sort of bringing the deal to the partnership? Different stages of investing or different types of investing, it can actually vary tremendously. Most venture partnerships, even though they seem large, ultimately you're going to converge on one or two people.
- The biggest thing I look for at seed stage is what to the discussion before kind of plan for the next fundraise. Every firm has its own culture and style. Venture firms are like marriages. Expect a different process in each firm.
- Tech BioContinuum. The founder led bio movement or the tech bio movement is marketing itself as different from biotech. The one thing that's clear is that the founder always matters. All of the companies in this space converge on a very special regulatory pathway.
- YC bio is one of the first investors in Illumina and has a long history in doing so. The company is looking to fund biotech companies in a more tech way. As long as genomics and tools are under biotech don't shoot the messenger.
- I think where it's most important is in the later stages when you're dealing with investment bankers and analysts. What you think your company is and what brand you use for it now may evolve. How you describe yourself should speak to investors hearts, not just their minds.
- So given the current climate or looking ahead, what are the sort of milestones you're looking for for a seed stage company? I'll tell you what we look for in our companies when we build them. The most important thing is my asses will be in your conference room at a whiteboard.
- Every round is about discharging risk risk is inversely proportional to price. A steady march towards risk discharging helps you raise future rounds. The most important thing for founders to think about is what is their value creating milestone.
- What truly defines a platform in an era when new modalities are being discovered seemingly at an ever faster rate? Maze: It's hard to know exactly what is a platform versus a product company. The reason investors often tell you they like platforms is that the cost to stand up a second program should be lower than the cost of that first program.
- There's a continuum of how platformy you are, right? And I like to look at companies on that spectrum. If you can provide lots of value without taking on lots of risk, that's a good position to be in.
- All. right, let's congratulate these VCs. You're doing the hard congratulate the entrepreneur. Yeah, everybody. Well, congratulations for you all.
